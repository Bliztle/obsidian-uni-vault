Then, the tree obtained by substituting the smaller with the larger subtree would have fewer nodes but still generating w. This is impossible because we assumed to use the parse tree with fewer number of nodes generating . r smaller parse parse tree for A tree forw W= UVXNe = UXz a ﬁ (Jvxy| < p) We chose R to be the repeating variable which appears lowest in the parse tree, that is, both occurrences are within the bottom | V| + I variables in the path. So the subtree generating vxy is at most | V| + 2 high, hence can have at most b2 = pleaves of terminals. Thus |vxy] < p.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
