This corresponds to a transition on a nonterminal reduce p: Reduce with the production numbered p: Pop symbols (interleaved with state numbers) corresponding to the right-hand side of the production Of the stack. This is always followed by a go action on the left-hand side nonterminal using the DFA state that is found after popping the right-hand side off the stack. accept: Parsing has completed successfully. errør: A syntax error has been detected.
