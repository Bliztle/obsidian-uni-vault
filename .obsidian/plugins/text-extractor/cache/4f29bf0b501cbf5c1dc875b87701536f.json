The interpreter that we have outlined in this video is really just an implementation of a big-step semantics. In a big-step semantics for our language, we would have transitions of the form envy,envp e — v for evaluating expressions, and the environments envy and envr correspond to the symbol tables vtable and ftable. The transition relation — is implemented in the interpreter as the function Eval. The right place to begin work on an implementation is to try to define a semantics of the language and use that to guide the implementation — not the other way around!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
