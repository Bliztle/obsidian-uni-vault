Then the following holds: (P) There exists p > 0 such that for any string w € A with |w| > p, there exists u, v, , y, z such that w = uvxyz, with vy £ ¢, |vxy| < p, and for all i > 0, the string uv'xyiz EA. Informally, if A is CF, then any sufficiently long string in A can be subdivided into 5 pieces such that: the middle three pieces are not too long, the 2nd and the 4th are not both null, and no matter how many extra copies of the 2nd and 4th you pump in simultaneously, the string stays in A","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
