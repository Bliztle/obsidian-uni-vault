Latency indicates the total number of clock cycles required to perform th« actual operations, while issue time indicates the minimum number of cycles between two independent operations. The capacity indicates how many of these operations car be issued simultaneously. The times for division depend on the data values.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
