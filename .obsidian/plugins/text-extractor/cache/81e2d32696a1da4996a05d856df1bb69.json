For a value x, we evaluate the polynomial by computing a + arx + arx® + - - + O\" (5.2) This evaluation can be implemented by the following function, having as argu- ments an array of coefficients a, a value x, and the polynomial degree degree (the value n in Equation 5.2). In this function, we compute both the successive terms of the equation and the successive powers of x within a single loop: 1 double poly(double a[], double x, long degree) 2 o 3 long i; 4 double result = a[0]; 5 double xpwr = x; /+ Equals x”i at start of loop +/ 6 for (i = 1; i <= degree; i++) { 7 result += a[i] + xpur; 8 XpWr = X % xpwr; 9 ) 10 return result; \" )3 A. For degree n, how many additions and how many multiplications does this code perform? B. On our reference machine, with arithmetic operations having the latencies shown in Figure 5.12, we measure the CPE for this function to be 5.00. Ex- plain how this CPE arises based on the data dependencies formed between iterations due to the operations implementing lines 7-8 of the function.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
