Recall that for disks, I PB = 10° MB. Then the following straight- forward translation of units yields the following predicted times for each case: A. Worst-case sequential writes (520 MB/s): (10 x 128) x (1/520) x (1/(86,400 x 365)) = 7 years B. Worst-case random writes (205 MB/s): (10° x 128) x (1/205) x (1/(86,400 x 365)) = 19 years C. Average case (50 GB/day): (10 x 128) x (1/50,000) x (1/365) = 6,912 ycars So even if the SSD operates continuously, it should last for at least 7 years, which is longer than the expected lifetime of most computers.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
