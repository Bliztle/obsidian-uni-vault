The strings s; represent the sequence of stack contents that M has on the accepting branch of the computation. 1. 79 = o and 59 = €. This condition signifies that M starts out properly, in the start state and with an empty stack. 2.

This condition states that M moves properly according to the state, stack, and next input symbol. 3. Tm € F. This condition states that an accept state occurs at the input end.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
