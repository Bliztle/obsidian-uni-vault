For degree n, how many additions and how many multiplications does this code perform? B. On our reference machine, with the arithmetic operations having the laten- cies shown in Figure 5.12, we measure the CPE for this function to be 8.00. Explain how this CPE arises based on the data dependencies formed be- tween iterations due to the operations implementing line 7 of the function. C. Explain how the function shown in Practice Problem 5.5 can run faster, even though it requires more operations.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
