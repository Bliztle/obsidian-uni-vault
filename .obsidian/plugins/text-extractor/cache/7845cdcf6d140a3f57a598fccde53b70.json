We can reduce the number of multiplications in evaluating a polyno- mial by applying Horner's method, named after British mathematician William G. Horner (1786—1837). The idea is to repeatedly factor out the powers of x to get the following evaluation: ag + x(aj +x(ay + - - 4 x(ay_y +xa,) - ) (53) Using Horner’s method, we can implement polynomial evaluation using the following code: 1 /* Apply Horner's method +/ 2 double polyh(double a[], double x, long degree) 3 A","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
