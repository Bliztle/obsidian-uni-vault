A function with prototype void decodel(long +xp, long *yp, long *zp); is compiled into assembly code, yielding the following: void decodet(long *xp, long +yp, long *zp) xp in %rdi, yp in krsi, zp in krdx decodel: movq (%rdi), 4r8 movq (frsi), 4rex movq — (4råx), 4rax movq — %r8, (krsi) movq — %rex, (krdx) movq — %rax, (krdi) ret Parameters xp, yp, and zp are stored in registers %rdi, %rsi, and %rdx, respec- tively. Write C code for decodet that will have an effect cquivalent to the assembly code shown.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
