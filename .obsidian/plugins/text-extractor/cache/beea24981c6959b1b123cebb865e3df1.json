Yes, from the class diagram (see Figure 4-3), it is evident that this pattern supports parallel class hierarchies. So, in this example, AnimalFactory, DogFactory, and TigerFactory are placed in one hierarchy, and Animal, Dog, and Tiger are placed in another hierarchy. So, the creators and their creations/ products are two hierarchies running in parallel.
