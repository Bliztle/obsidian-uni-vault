If there is no node with less than N edges, pick any node and do as above. If there are still nodes left in the graph, continue with simplify, otherwise go to select. select: Pop a node and its list of connected nodes off the stack. If possible, give the node a colour that is different from the colours of the connected nodes (which are all coloured at this point). If this is not possible, colouring fails and we mark the node for spilling (see below). If there are still nodes on the stack, continue with select, otherwise we are done. If any nodes are marked for spilling, we must handle this (See Sect. 8.5) and redo graph colouring. The idea in this algorithm is that, even though a node has V or more edges, some of the nodes it is connected to may have been given identical colours, so the total number of colours used for these nodes is less than V. If this is the case, we can use one of the unused colours. If not, we must mark the node for spill. There are several things left unspecified by Algorithm 8.3: e Which node to choose in simplify, when none have less than N edges, and e Which colour to choose in seleet, if there are several choices.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
