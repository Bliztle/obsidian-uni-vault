Conditional Set Instructions + ”sETcc': Sets a byte to 0 or 1 based on the evaluation of a condition (e.g., 'SETZ', ”SETNZ', 'SETS', 'SETNS”, \"SETO\", 'SETNO”). Examples of How Flags are Affected: + ADD/SUB: Affects OF, SF, ZF, AF (auxiliary carry flag), PF (parity flag), and CF (carry flag). + AND/OR/XOR: Affects SF, ZF, and PF; clears OF and CF. + CMP/TEST: Affects SF, ZF, and PF based on the result of the comparison. These instructions utilize the flags to facilitate conditional operations, branching, and other logic in assembly language programming.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
