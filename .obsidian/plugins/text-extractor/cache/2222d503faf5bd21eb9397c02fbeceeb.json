(see below about hardware/OS assumptions; the first two exercises can be done in the current VM) Here is given a pthreads program that does matrix-multiplication according to the ijk method (CSPP3 page 681) and measures its execution time (in clock-cycles.) as function of the number of worker threads. 1) Why are no mutexes required in this solution? 2) What is the overhead of using more and more threads when you exceed the number of cores in your machine? 3) Plot the execution time as function of the number of worker threads. Also plot the speedup (here you may use the execution time of this program with one worker thread as approximation) 4) Also vary the problem size: try with matrix sizes: 500*500, 200*200, 100*100, 50\"50, 2020, 10\"10, 5*5. At which point do you no longer gain from parallel execution? 5) Add the matrix-multiplication procedure using kij-method, and benchmark that as well. Beware your solution does not have race-conditions.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
