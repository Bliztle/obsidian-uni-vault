These intended and perceived behaviours are usually very simple, including sliding pressing and rotating. E Real affordances are not nearly as important as perceived affordances; it is perceived affordances that tell the user what actions can be performed on an object and, to some extent, how to do them. [Perceived affordances are] often more about conventions than about reality.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
