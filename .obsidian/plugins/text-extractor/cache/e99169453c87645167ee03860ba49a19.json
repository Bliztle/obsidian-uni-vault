It s also interesting from a local- ity point of view because its reference pattern is both row-wise and column-wise. For example, consider the following transpose routine: 1 typedef int array[2][2]; 2 3 void transposel(array dst, array src) t 5 int i, j; 5 7 for (i =0; i < 2; i4) Â£ s for (j = 0; j < 2; jen { 5 t [;) = srel3)[3); 0 > n > z )","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
