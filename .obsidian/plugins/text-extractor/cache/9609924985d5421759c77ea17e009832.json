Suppose that the following property holds: (=P) For all p > 0, there exists a string w € A with|w| > p such that, for all u, v, x, y, z with w = uvxyz, vy % €, and |vxy| < p, there exists i > 0 such that uv'xy'z & A. Then, A is not context-free. 10 prove that a given language A is not context-free we need to establish that (~7) holds of A","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
