O Compute succ(i), gen(i) and kill(i) for each 1 < i < n @ Use the fixpoint algorithm to iteratively find the sets in(i) and out(i) for each i where I < i < n. Ø Find out for cach i where 1 < i < n which variables interfere with cach other at instruction i Ø Build an interference graph with m vertices where there is an edge between z and y if interferes with y at some instruction. Ø Try to find a vertex colonring with n colours for the interference graph. Some of the m variables may not get a colour - they need to be spilled (reside in memory) Ø Go buck to step 1 if register allocation is still not possible,","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
