Note that unlike the usual technique for swapping two values, we do not need a third location to temporarily store one value while we are moving the other. There is no performance advantage to this way of swapping; it is merely an intellectual amusement. Starting with values a and b in the locations pointed to by x and y, respectively, fill in the table that follows, giving the values stored at the two locations after each step of the procedure. Use the properties of ” to show that the desired effect is achicved. Recall that cvery clement is its own additive inverse (that is, a ” a = 0).
