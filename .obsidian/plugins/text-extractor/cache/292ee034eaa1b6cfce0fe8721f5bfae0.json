Eliminate ambiguity that can not be resolved by prioritising productions. 2. Eliminate left-recursion. 3. Perform left factorisation where required. 4. Add an extra start production 5' — S$ to the grammar. 5. Calculate FIRST for every production and FOLLOW for every nonterminal. 6. For nonterminal N and input symbol ¢, choose production N — & when: e c & FIRST (a), or e Nullable(a) and ¢ € FOLLOW(N). This choice is encoded either in a table or a recursive-descent program. 7. Use production priorities to eliminate conflicts where appropriate.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
