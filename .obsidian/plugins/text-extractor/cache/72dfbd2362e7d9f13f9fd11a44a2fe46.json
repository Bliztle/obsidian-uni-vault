Assume w € A such that |w| > p. Then the parse tree of w must be at least | V| + 1 high, with one path from root to leaves using | V| + I variables. Take the smallest of such parse trees. By the pigeonhole principle, some variable R appears more than once on that path. Choose the variable R which appears lowest in the tree. We split w into uvxyz as below T rm F z u v oz 3 7 0 Since R is repeated, we can construct parse trees for uv'xy'z, for all i > 0, thus these strings are also in A. Next we check that also the other conditions about the splitting w = uvxyz are satisfied. continues in the next page…","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
