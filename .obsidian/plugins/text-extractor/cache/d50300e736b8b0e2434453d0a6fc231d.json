In the current version it returns the value of the global count. 3.1) Design an alternative get(counter t\"c) method that also lock all local counters and return a sum of global and the local counters: getAll(counter t\"c). (scerlig vigtig) 3.2) Under what circumstances would this give (and would not give) an up-to-date count with good performance? 3.3) implement your solution and try it out in the virtual machine. You will need to change to main function to create a printCount thread that runs concurrently with the run_counter threads. The printCount function is to iteratively call getAll foloowed by a sleep(1); The books code can be fetched from below. slop. counter.c https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code/tree/master/include Compile with -Ipthread to link with pthread library","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
