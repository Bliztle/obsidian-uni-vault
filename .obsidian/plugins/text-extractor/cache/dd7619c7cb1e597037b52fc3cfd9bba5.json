Notice that each cache line holds exactly one row of the array, that the cache is exactly large enough to hold one array, and that for all i, row i of src and dst maps to the same cache line. Because the cache is too small to hold both arrays,references toone array keep evicting useful lines from the other array. For example, the write to dst [0] [0] cvicts the line that was loaded when we read src [0] [0]. So when we next read src [0] [1], we have a miss. dst array src array Col.0 Col. 1 Col. 0 Col. 1 Row 0 m m Row 0 m m Row 1 m m Row 1 m h B. When the cache is 32 bytes, it is large enough to hold both arrays. Thus, the only misses arc the initial cold misscs. dst array src array Col.0 Col. 1 Col. 0 Col. 1 Row 0 m h Row 0 m h Row 1 m h Row 1 m h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
