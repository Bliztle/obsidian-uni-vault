The C com- piler would not normally generate this instruction, so we must use hand-generated assembly code for this task. Here is a test function we have written (Web Aside ASM:EASM on page 214 describes how to write programs that combine C code with handwritten assembly code): 1 .text 2 .globl pushtest 3 pushtest: 4 movq %rsp, %hrax Copy stack pointer 5 pushq Y%rsp Push stack pointer 6 popq %rdx Pop it back 7 subq %rdx, 4rax â€” Return 0 or 4 8 ret In our experiments, we find that function pushtest always returns 0. What does this imply about the behavior of the instruction pushq %rsp under x86-64?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
