Different combinations of pipeline depth (how many stages) and maximum throughput arise, depending on where we insert the pipeline registers. Assume that a pipeline register has a delay of 20 ps. A. Inserting a single register gives a two-stage pipeline. Where should the register be inserted to maximize throughput? What would be the throughput and latency?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
