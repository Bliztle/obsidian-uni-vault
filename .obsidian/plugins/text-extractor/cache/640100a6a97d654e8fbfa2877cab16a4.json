These are used as source values, either as data or to compute mem- ory addresses, but they are not modified within the loop. The only read- only register for the loop in combines is %rax. Write-only. These are used as the destinations of data-movement operations. There are no such registers in this loop. Local. These are updated and used within the loop, but there is no dependency from one iteration to another. The condition code registers are examples for this loop: they are updated by the cmp operation and used by the jne operation, but this dependency is contained within individual iterations. Loop. These are used both as source values and as destinations for the loop, with the value generated in one iteration being used in another. We can see that %rdx and %m0 are loop registers for combine4, corresponding to program values data+i and acc.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
