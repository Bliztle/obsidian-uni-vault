Ø Transfer the parameters from aj, ..., a, to the registers or stack locations used to pass parameters. Ø Restore the callee-saves registers that were used in the body of g. This can include the return address register. Ø Free the space used for storing variables and other entities. This can include the space used to store the return address.
