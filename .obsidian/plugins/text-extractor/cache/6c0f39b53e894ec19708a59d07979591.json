We reproduce his top-level headings here, together with a sample question for each issue. Understandable Does the image spontaneously suggest the intended concept to the viewer? Are the objects in the icon ones that are familiar to the user? Unambiguous Are additional cues (label, other icon documentation) available to resolve any ambiguity? Memorable Where possible, does the icon feature concrete objects in action? Are actions shown as operations on concrete objects? Wiy i heconcept Imporant? Is the number of arbitrary symbols less than 20? h evey k it rom l oier? Does the image use smooth edges and lines? Legible Have you tested all combinations of colour and size in which the icon will be displayed? Is every object, every line, every pixel in the icon necessary? l t dea where an kon ends and arother begins? Can I draw the image smaller? Will people still recognize it?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
