Consider the language Ls ={uu | u € fa,b)\"). We use the pumping lemma to show that Ls is not context-free. Choose w = aabbaabb. So we can split it into u = aa, v = b, x = baa, y = bb and z = c. But then we have that uv?xy?z ¢ Ls. Explain the main reasons why the above attempt of proof is wrong.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
