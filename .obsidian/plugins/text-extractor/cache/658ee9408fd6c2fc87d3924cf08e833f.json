Just before the clock rises at time 240 (point 1), instructions 11 (shown in dark gray) and I2 (shown in blue) have completed stages B and A. After the clock rises, these instructions begin propagating through stages C and B, while instruction T3 (shown in light gray) begins propagating through stage A (points 2 and 3). Just before the clock rises again, the results for the instructions have propagated to the inputs of the pipeline registers (point 4).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
