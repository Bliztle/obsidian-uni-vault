The system should primarily be an administrative tool, but secondarily serve as a communication medi- um for the program committee, the organizing committee, and the lo- cal administrative personnel to help them manage the conference. The system should be based on a cheap PC with current tools. The system should also be able to function in different types of environ- ments, including use by volunteers who have great enthusiasm and greatly variable administrative experience.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
