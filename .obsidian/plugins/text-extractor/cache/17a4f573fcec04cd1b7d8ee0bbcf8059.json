I tell him, “I'm not really interested in how many windows you have, but I am interested in how you go about doing this task.” Some users will sit quietly, then say, \"12.” I then point out that I have learned nothing about how they arrived at that answer. I ask them to try again, but this time, to work harder at thinking aloud. They try again, \"Okay, in my kitchen, I have one over the sink, in the living room there are three, the den has one behind the couch....” At that point, I stop them. “Okay. Now | have some insight into how you're solving the problem: you imagine yourself inside your house, then mentally go from room to room counting the windows, starting with the kitchen.” same-as-thinking-aloud.php","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
