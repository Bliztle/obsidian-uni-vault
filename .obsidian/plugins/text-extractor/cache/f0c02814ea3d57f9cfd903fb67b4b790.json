Then, by dividing both sides of the last equation by p! we get L+|yl(p+ D =nn-1)n-2)-(p+2)(p+1). But this is impossible, as the right-hand side is divisible by (p + 1) while the left-hand side is not. Thus, the choice of i above is the winning one to show the language C to be nonregular.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
