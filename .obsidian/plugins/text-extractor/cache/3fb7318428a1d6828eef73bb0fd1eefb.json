Given this assumption, estimate the lifetime (in years) of this SSD for the following workloads: A. Worst case for sequential writes: The SSD is written to continuously at a rate of 470 MB/s (the average sequential write throughput of the device). B. Worst case for random writes: The SSD is written to continuously at a rate of 303 MB/s (the average random write throughput of the device). C. Average case: The SSD is written to at a rate of 20 GB/day (the average daily write rate assumed by some computer manufacturers in their mobile computer workload simulations).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"dan+eng"}
