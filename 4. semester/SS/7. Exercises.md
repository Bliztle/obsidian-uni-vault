Show that $L_{2}=\{\}$ is non-context-free
1. The demon picks some number $p$
2. We pick $w=$
	1. (you followed the rules as $w\in L_{1}$ and $|w|=\geq p$)
3. The demon picks $u,v,x,y,z$ s.t. $w=uvxyz$, $vy\neq\epsilon$, and $|vxy|\leq p$
4. No matter what the demon picked you can take $i=\alpha$ and you win. Indeed, by $|vxy|\leq p$, $y$ is

#### Ex 1.1
$L_{1}$ recognises $a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}$ which we know not to be regular
###### Demon
Show that $L_{1}$ is non-context-free
1. The demon picks some number $p$
2. We pick $w=a^{p}b^{p}c^{p}$
	1. (you followed the rules as $w\in L_{1}$ and $|w|=\geq p$)
3. The demon picks $u,v,x,y,z$ s.t. $w=uvxyz$, $vy\neq\epsilon$, and $|vxy|\leq p$

Case 1: both $v$ and $y$ contain only 1 type of symbol each
1. $vy$ contains c's -- we pick $i=0$
	- Indeed $uv^{0}xy^{0}z\notin A$, as it has fewer c's than a's or b's
2. $vy$ does not contain c's -- we pick $i=2$
	- Indeed $uv^{2}xy^{2}z\notin A$, as it has fewer c's than a's or b's
Case 2: either $v$ or $y$ contain more than one type of symbol
1. We pick $i=2$.  Indeed $uv^{2}xy^{2}z\notin L(a^{*}b^{*}c^{*})\subseteq A$
$\square$
#### Ex 1.2
$S\rightarrow AC$
$A\rightarrow aAb | \epsilon$
$C\rightarrow cC | \epsilon$
$\square$
#### Ex 1.3
$S\rightarrow ABC$
$A\rightarrow aA | \epsilon$
$B\rightarrow bBc | \epsilon$
$C\rightarrow cC | \epsilon$
$\square$
## Exercise 2

###### Demon
Show that $L_{4}$ is non-context-free
1. The demon picks some number $p$
2. We pick $w=0^{p}1^{p}\#0^{p}1^{p}$
	1. (you followed the rules as $w\in L_{4}$ and $|w|=\geq p$)
3. The demon picks $u,v,x,y,z$ s.t. $w=uvxyz$, $vy\neq\epsilon$, and $|vxy|\leq p$

Case 1: $vxy$ does not straddle the middle of $w$
1. $vxy$ is in the first half of $w$ -- we pick $i=2$
	- First half is now longer than the second, meaning $uv^{2}xy^{2}z\notin L_{4}$
1. $vxy$ in in the second half of $w$ -- we pick $i=0$
	- First half is now longer than the second, meaning $uv^{0}xy^{0}z\notin L_{4}$
case 2: $vxy$ straddles the middle of $w$ -- we pick $i=0$
1. # is in $vy$, $uv^{0}xy^{0}z\notin L_{4}$
2. # is not in $vy$ -- as $|vxy|\leq p$, we get $uv^{0}xy^{0}z=0^{p}1^{j}\#0^{i}1^{p}$, where $i$ and $j$ cannot both be $p$. Thus $uv^{0}xy^{0}z\notin L_{4}$
$\square$
## Exercise 3\*

- It is not a universal winning strategy,  as it does not work for some general split of the string
- P is never chosen, so we could always set it higher than $|w|$
