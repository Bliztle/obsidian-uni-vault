## Ex 6
Proof by contradiction
Suppose the statement is false. That means $n<10\land m<10$, meaning their greatest value is 9. As such, the greatest sum $n+m$ equals 18, which is less than 19. This is a contradiction, and as such, the statement is true.

The two removed horses are never compared. From an induction perspective, 

## Ex 8
Induction hypothesis: $4^k+14=6n$

To finish the proof, it is sufficient to show that $n\in \mathbb{N}$

Base case: $n=1 \rightarrow 4^{1}+14=18|6$ 

Induction step

$$4^{k+1}+14=6n$$
$$4^{k}*4+14=6n$$$$(6m-14)*4+14=6n$$
$$24m-56+14=24m-42=6n$$
$$4m-7=n$$
since $4m$ is an integer and 7 is as well, $n$ has to be an integer as well
