**The pumping lemma does *not* prove a language to be regular. This can only be fully shown by constructing an automaton or regex. It can only show languages *NOT* to be**
## Non-regular proofs

#### Proof of $a^{n}b^{n}$

Assume $n>>p$
with $n$ $a$'s, there should be a loop, or a string which can be taken out (or inserted again multiple times) and still be recognised, but doing that we get a machine which would also recognise other strings. As such, it is not regular, by contradiction.

#### General proofs
Based on $A\rightarrow B$ with A being "is regular" and b being the pumping property". This is then reversed bu contraposition. As such, $\lnot B\rightarrow A$

#### Demon Game
![](Pasted%20image%2020240227090742.png)
If the demon has the machine, it picks $p$ as the number of states, and splits correctly. We cannot win.
- Either us or the demon has a *universal win strategy*

###### Playing the game
Write all choices down in generics

This example works because the result by inserting is not a duplicated string anymore.

We add $i-1$ $y$'s, and show that the length is no longer factorial, no matter the $n$. Note that this $n$ is not the same as in the language description.

Equation was rewritten using $(p+1)!=(p+1)p!$ giving $p!+|y|(p+1)!=p!+|y|(p+1)p!=p!(|y|(p+1))$

The two sides of the last equation cannot be equal, as the right clearly divides $(p+1)$, but the left does not.

#### Simplifying problems
Since regular languages are closed under certain operations, problems can be simplified by this

- Intersecting a language with some other language can give a language we know to be non-regular
	- Consider $D=\{w|w$ has equal number of $a$'s and $b$'s$\}$
		  $D\cap L(a^{*}b^{*})=\{a^{n}b^{n}|n\geq0\}$ which we know to be non-regular
	- **At the exam we can refer to previous exercises. We do NOT have to prove the rest of the statement**
