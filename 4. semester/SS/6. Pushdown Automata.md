## Pushdown Automata (PDA)
#itc/2-2 
SS equivalent to SPO LL(1) parser
Non-deterministic PDA recognises more than deterministic PDA
- We focus on deterministic, given equivalent power with context-free grammar

4. $\delta: Q\times\Sigma_{\epsilon}\times\Gamma_{\epsilon}\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_{\epsilon})$ means current state, input and stack gives a set of tuples of states and transitions

Written as finite automata, $a,b\rightarrow c$ indicates reading $a$ lets you replace $b$ with $c$ on stack.
- $a=\epsilon$ do not change input
- $b=\epsilon$ add $c$ to stack
- $c=\epsilon$ removes $b$ from stack
Formally end of input cannot be read. Hence the added $\$$
###### Example
Both representations of $\{0^{n}1^{n}|n\geq0\}$:

table - read input, replace stack token with right-hand side of tuble. Go to state.

Read input, replace left side with right side. Start and end push and pop \$

## Equivalence with CFG
Proof is 8 pages (117-125)
- Show how to convert CFG $G$ generating CFA to a PDA $P$
	- $P$ accepts input $w$ if $G$ generates it through derivations
		- Each derivation produces an ***intermediate string***
	- Design PDA $P$ to determine whether derivations using $G$ can produce $w$
		- ***THIS NEEDS FURTHER EXPLANATION***
- Convert PDA to CFG generating CFA
	- Make $G$ from $P$, such that $G$ generates all strings $P$ accepts
	- Design special grammar with more
		- For each pair of states $(p,q)$, the grammar has a variable $A_{pq}$ with all strings taking $p$ with empty stack to $q$ with empty stack
			- Means stack is never modified
	- Modify with 3 features
		1. Single accept state $q_{accept}$
		2. Empties stack before accepting
		3. Transitions either push or pop, but never both
			- Replace transitions which both pop and push with 2 transitions and intermediate state
			- replace those who do neither with 2 transitions and intermediate state, pushing / popping arbitrary stack symbol
	- For $x\in A_{pq}$
		- First move must be a push
		- Last must be a pop
		- 2 options
			- last pop is the symbol first pushed. With $a$ as first input and $b$ as last:
				- $A_{pq}\rightarrow aA_{rs}b$
			- Stack was empty at some point
				- $A_{pq}\rightarrow A_{pq}A_{rq}$

Proof by induction follows from this idea, generating $G$ as below and proving it accepts
