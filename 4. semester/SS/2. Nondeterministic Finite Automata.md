## Nondeterminism
#itc/1-2
DFA: *Derterministic Finite Automata*
NFA: *Nonderterministic Finite Automata*
![](Pasted%20image%2020240208201002.png)
A kind of concurrent machine, which splits into multiple executions when multiple transitions are triggered at once. Executions stop when the input does not lead to a new state. If any executions are in an accept state, the NFA accepts the input.
$\epsilon$ splits instantly

Any NFA can be turned into a DFA.

**Formal definition**
$(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F)$
- $Q$ is the set of *states*
- $\sum$ is an *alphabet*
- $\delta:Q\times\Sigma_{\epsilon}\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is the *transition function*
- $q_{0}\in Q$ is the *start state*
- $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of *accept states*

Accepts given 3 conditions
1. $r_{0}=q_{0}$
2. $r_{i+1}\in\delta(r_{i},y_{i+1})$, for $i=0,\dots,m-1$
3. $r_{m}\in F$

## Converting NFA to DFA
#itc/1-2 
$(Q',\Sigma',\delta',q'_{0},F')$
- $Q'$ = $\mathcal{P}(Q)$
- $\Sigma'=\Sigma$
- $\delta:Q\times\Sigma_{\epsilon}\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is the *transition function*
- $q'_{0}=E(\{q_{0}\})$, the start state and any state reachable by $\epsilon$
- $F'=\{q_{i}\in Q'|q_{i}\cap F \supset Ã˜\}$, all states containing one of NFA's accept states.

Note that while states may be denoted as sets, that is only because they represent a set of NFA states. They are nonetheless singular states.

## Closures

NFAs are also closed under all regular operations
