## Non-Context-Free Languages
#itd/2-3 
Like for regular languages
- Every context-free language has a *pumping length* such that all longer strings can be pumped
- This time in 5 parts, repeating parts 2 and 4

#### Proof idea
*Idea from the book. Notes only cover this and lecture*
string $s\in A$ of length $>p$
1. $\forall i\geq0\ .uv^{i}xy^{i}z\in A$
2. $|vy|>0$
3. $|vxy|\leq p$
(2) states either $v$ or $y$ is not empty
(3) is useful limiting length "after" pumping

Given some *very long* string $s\in A$, we get a *very tall* parse tree.
- By pidgeon-hole, repititions exist
- In figure below, second $R$ can be substituted by first $R$, gicing the 5 parts on the left
- or first $R$ can be substituted by second $R$, giving the right
	- here $v^{i}y^{i}=\epsilon$
