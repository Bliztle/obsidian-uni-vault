## Nonregular Languages
#itc/1-4 
Not all languages are regular, but we need a way to prove it.
All regular languages have a special property, so proving this exists (or doesn't) proves if it is regular
## The Pumping Lemma
For regular languages:
- All strings longer than the *pumping length* can be *pumped*
	- Each string has a repeatable substring which remains in the language

#### Pumping Lemma 
If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$ where if $s$ is a string in $A$ with $|s|\geq p$, then $s$ can be divided in 3 parts satisfying the following:
1. $\forall i\geq0\ \ .\ xy^{i}z\in A$
2. $|y|>0$
3. $|xy|\leq p$

#### Proof Idea
let $p$ be the number of states in $A$
if $|s|<p$ then the lemma is trivially true, as it is not considered
if $|s|>p$ then a repetition must have occurred, as there are only p states
