Describes patterns in text

## Formal Definition
$R$ is a *regular expression* if $R$ is any of the following
- $a\in\Sigma$
- $\epsilon$
- $Ã˜$
- $(R_{1}\cup R_{2})$
- $(R_{1}\circ R_{2})$
- $(R^{*}_{1})$
Inductive definition, as R is defined in terms of smaller $R_{i}$s

$L(R)$ is the language describing $R$.
- $0^{*}10^{*}=\{w|w$ contains a single $1\}$.

## Equivalence with Finite Automata
And regular expression can be described as a finite automata and vice versa. Converting to NFA is much easier
