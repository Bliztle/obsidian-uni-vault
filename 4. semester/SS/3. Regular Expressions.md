Describes patterns in text

## Formal Definition
#itc/1-3
$R$ is a *regular expression* if $R$ is any of the following
- $a\in\Sigma$
- $\epsilon$
- $Ø$
- $(R_{1}\cup R_{2})$
- $(R_{1}\circ R_{2})$
- $(R^{*}_{1})$
Inductive definition, as R is defined in terms of smaller $R_{i}$s

$L(R)$ is the language describing $R$.
- $0^{*}10^{*}=\{w|w$ contains a single $1\}$.

## Equivalence with Finite Automata
#itc/1-3
And regular expression can be described as a finite automata and vice versa. Converting to NFA is much easier.

###### Proof
- Show all 6 regex cases are described by an NFA
- Show all regular languages are described by a regular expression
	- Show all regular languages are GNFAs and all GNFAs can be regex
		1. Create GNFA with k states
		2. Since start and accept must be different, $k\geq2$
		3. if $k>2$, construct an equivalent GNFA with $k-1$ states, by union of transitions
		4. if $k>2$, repeat step 3
		5. $k=2$, the regex is the label from start to accept

#### Generalised NFA (GNFA)
NFAs with labels of regexes

Book works with a special convenient version
- Start has transitions to all other states, but no incoming transition
- One accept state, with incoming transitions from all other states
	- No outgoing transitions
- All other states must transition to all other states, including themselves
	- except of course to the start state

Created as
1. New start state with $\epsilon$ to old start state
2. New accept state with $\epsilon$ from old accept states
3. Correct transitions with multiple labels to regex syntax
4. Create missing transitions with $Ø$
