*If pumping for CFG is on the exam, it will be very simple, maybe have hints, and there are points for simply trying or showing what that we know what the pumping lemma is*

## Proof of the pumping lemma

is $|V|$ the amount of production rules in the grammar??
$b$ is the maximum amount of children? idk
- In binary tree, if height is h, there are $2^{h}$ leaves (out-degree). Same idea
