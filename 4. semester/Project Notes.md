State machine idea
- It should be possible for us to model most relevant information in a finite way by giving machines static properties on top of its state. World simulation could just give tiles x/y coords.
- Does having broadcasts be controllable as something other than state cause issues with provability?
	- Static could set reference to other machine instead of broadcast?
