# DFA
#itcd/1-4
Closer to the machine.

|  | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| $\epsilon$-closure | The set of states reachable as well as any epsilon-extended states. *Least* solution to the equation below.<br><br>$X=M\cup\{t\mid s\in X \land s^{\epsilon}t\in T\}$ |

## Set equations
#itcd/1-5-1
$F(X)=X$

In the case that there are more than a single solution, we want the *least* $X$

**Solving monotonic set equations**
*find the least $X$ such that* $X\subseteq Y \rightarrow F(X)\subseteq F(Y)$

Solution steps:
1. Guess $Ø$ is a solution
	1. If it is, we are done
2. Note the following two properties
	1. The least solution $S$ satisfies $S=F(S)$
	2. $Ø\subseteq S\rightarrow F(Ø)\subseteq F(S)$
3. Conclude $F(Ø)\subseteq S$
4. Thus $Ø\subseteq F(Ø)\subseteq F(F(Ø))\subseteq\dots$

Example on $\epsilon$-closure$(\{1\})$
![](Pasted%20image%2020240217124734.png)
The *work-list algorithm* solves this by marking an element once $s^{\epsilon}t$ has been calculated, not including it in further calculations, as the result already exists in the set.

## The Subset Construction
#itcd/1-5-2 #itcd/algorithm/1-3
Created from NFA with
- $s_{0}'=\epsilon\text{-closure}(\{s_{0}\})$
- $move(s',c)=\epsilon\text{-closure}(\{t|s\in s'\ \text{and}\ s^{c}t\in T\})$
- $S'=\{s_{0}'\}\cup\{move(s',c)|s'\in S',c\in\Sigma\}$
- $F'=\{s'\in S'|s'\cap F\supset Ø\}$
- 
$S'$ can be constructed with the work-list algorithm on $s_{0}'$, which in turn is calculated from $s_{0}$.
###### Size vs Speed
#itcd/1-6
- $N\rightarrow$ size of NFA
- $v\rightarrow$ input length
- $c,k\rightarrow$ constants where typically $c>k$

|  | Size | Speed |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| NFA | $n$ | $c\cdot\begin{vmatrix}N\end{vmatrix}\cdot\begin{vmatrix}v\end{vmatrix}$ |
| DFA | $O(2^{n}-1)$ | $k\cdot\begin{vmatrix}v\end{vmatrix}$ |

## Minimisation of DFAs
#itcd/1-7
All regex have a *unique* minimal DFA, so equivalences (between regex, DFA, NFA) are found by comparing these.

Relies on 2 rules
- An accepting state is different from a non-accepting state
- $(s_{1}^{c}t_{1}\land s_{2}^{c}t_{2} \rightarrow t_{1}\neq t_{2}) \rightarrow s_{1}\neq s_{2}$
	- If $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ transition to $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ on the same input, then $t_{1}\neq t_{2} \rightarrow s_{1}\neq s_{2}$

#### The algorithm
#itcd/algorithm/1-4
Given DFA $D,\Sigma,S,F$ we construct $D_{min}$ where each state is a group of equivalent states from $D$.
- Groups are *consistent*.
	- If $s_{1},s_{2}$ are in a group, then $move(s_{1},c),move(s_{2},c)$ are either in the same group or undefined
	- I.e. we cannot tell $s_{1},s_{2}$ apart

The algorithm assumes that the DFA does not both have dead states and incomplete transitions at once.

The steps:
1. Start with groups $F$ and $S\setminus F$
	1. both unmarked
2. Pick unmarked group G.
	1. If it is consistent, mark it
	2. Otherwise split into maximal consistent subgroups, and replace G with these
		1. Maximal meaning adding an element would make it inconsistent
		2. **ALL** groups are now unmarked
3. If not done, repeat step 2
	1. Otherwise, all groups are states in $D_{min}$

Step 2 can optimally be done in $O(n\log n)$ time

###### Issues
The algorithm stops working under two conditions
- DFA contains dead states, i.e. states from which no accepting state can be reached
- $move$ is not total, i.e. some transitions don't exist
	- Wouldn't this make it an NFA???

## Lexers and Lexer Generators
#itcd/1-8
Generates a lexer from a set of regexes

Works in 5 steps
1. Construct NFAs . N1, N2, . . . , N n for each of.r1, r2, . . . , r n .
2. Mark the accepting states of the NFAs by the name of the tokens they accept.
3. Combine the NFAs to a single NFA by adding a new starting state which has epsilon-transitions to each of the starting states of the NFAs.
4. Convert the combined NFA to a DFA.
5. Each accepting state of the DFA consists of a set of NFA states, at least one of which is an accepting state which we marked by token type in step 2. These marks are used to mark the accepting states of the DFA, so each of these will indicate all the token types it accepts.

Most lexer generators resolve conflicts according to two rules
1. Longest prefix which matches
2. The order in which regexes were defined

#question
If the above was true, how are the following statements not equivalent?
```java
// Setup
int a = 3

a -1 // Rules dictate ["a", "-1"] but executes ["a", "-", "1"]
a (-1) // Rules dictate ["a", "(-1)"] which should simplify to the same as ["a", "-1)"]

```

#### Lexer Generators
#itcd/1-8-1
- often uses '\*' or "\*" to indicate the symbol, \* to indicate multiplication
- Translates each accepted state to a token data type (NUM, ID, etc.) with related data (token name, integer value, etc.)
- Whitespace is usually ignored, though python, haskell, etc. breaks this

## Properties of Regular Languages
#itcd/1-9
Some properties and examples

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Relative expressive power<br>#itcd/1-9-1 | They can all do the same, but may not be equally suitable.<br>- A 6-state DFA can describe all numbers dividable by 5, but it is a very complicated regex<br><br>Not all NFA's can be written as regex in proportional size. That only goes the other way. |
| Limits to expressive power<br>#itcd/1-9-1 | Any language with unbounded counting is not regular.<br>- $\{a^n b^n \mid n\geq 0\}$, as a's need to be counted onboundedly.<br><br>However, the language of all valid java programs less than size $n$ is regular, and so is any language of numbers which evenly divide $n$. |
| Closure properties<br>#itcd/1-9-3<br><br>\*Not exhaustive | From basic operators:<br>- union<br>- concatenation<br>- unbounded repitition<br><br>Set operations:<br>- set difference<br>- set intersection<br><br>Common String operations\*<br>- prefix<br>- suffix<br>- subsequence<br>- reversal |
