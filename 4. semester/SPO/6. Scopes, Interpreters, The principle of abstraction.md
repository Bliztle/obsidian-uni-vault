- To be able to give a precise explanation of the notions of binding and bound occurrences and free variables
	- Bound refers back to binding. Free variables are not bound.
	- Variable defined in scope outside i.e. a function is also free, but refers to old variable
- To be able to give a precise explanation of the notions of static and dynamic scope rules
	- Using declaration time or call time bindings
- To be able to reason about program behaviour under notions of static and dynamic scope rules
	- static is IMO more predictable, but maybe harder to implement
- To be able to give a precise account of the notion of a binding model and how environments relate to symbol tables
	- Environments are partial functions, telling us which identifiers we know, and their values
	- $env: Identifiers\rightharpoonup Values$
- To be able to explain the important operations om symbol tables
- To be able to describe and carry out the main steps of an interpreter
## Scopes
#itcd/3 
*names* with *declarations* with *bindings* describing properties of the item. *uses* are references, often *scoped* to a part of the program, making a *local declaration*.
- *closest declaration* is the smallest sub-tree enclosing the *uses* of a *name*
3 kinds, can be mixed
1. Global scope
	- Flat, everything available everywhere (after declaration)
2. Partitioned scope
	- Flat with unique identifier within a context, like haskell types. Doesn't have to be unique outside it.
		- Does this include separate function environment?
3. Nested scope
	- Inner declarations shadow / hide outer ones

If declaration order matters, it is *cumulative*. Otherwise, *independent*

#### Symbol tables
#itcd/3-1 *environments*
Table binding names to properties.
Needs operations
- *empty* in which no names are defined
- *bind* a name to properties of an item. If already defined, new takes precedence (but doesn't erase)
	- Binding may be a declaration (binding) or definition (bound), though declaration may include definition
	- Assignment indicate value can change
- *look up* to find properties. Report error if not found.
- *enter* new scope
- *exit* a scope
###### Simple persistent symbol table
*functional symbol table*
new tables are created for each change, never modified. Found in functional languages
*implemented with a list*

| Operation |                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty     | An empty list                                                                                                 |
| Bind      | append (name, properties) pair to list                                                                        |
| Lookup    | search for pair with matching name. If not found, exception or option (rust) / maybe (haskell) type is needed |
| Enter     | make reference to old list                                                                                    |
| Exit      | use old list                                                                                                  |
- The latter to are not strictly operations, but rather just variables holding a reference
###### Simple imperative symbol table
Single mutable table, implemented as a stack

| Operation |                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty     | An empty stack                                      |
| Bind      | push (name, properties) pair to stack               |
| Lookup    | search stack for match. Report error when not found |
| Enter     | Push marker to stack                                |
| Exit      | Pop 'till marker                                    |
Hash-tables with auxilery stack, or persistent binary search trees can speed this up

## Intepretation
#itcd/4
One function per syntactic category, taking an AST and returning a value, changed tree, or nothing, relying on sideeffects.
###### Evaluating expressions
#itcd/4-3-1
Book uses distinct symbol tables for variables and funtions, $vtable$ and $ftable$
- `id` and `num` are assumed to have functions to get their values

Evaluating in simple functional language:

Interpretation wastes most of the time checking what to do and whether it is allowed, which can be improved with static type-checking and compilation, leaving only execution for the runtime. JIT is special, and not covered in the book.
