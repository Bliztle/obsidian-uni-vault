|         | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dynamic | Runtime                                                                                                                                                       |
| Static  | Compile-time                                                                                                                                                  |
| Strong  | Operations are only performed with valid types<br>- Verified before performing action                                                                         |
| Weak    | Operations are performed no matter if they make sense for the type<br>- Machine code just does it<br>- JS simply says *yes*<br>instead of reporting a problem |

###### Type Safety
Ensuring expressions always have the expected type
- Program cannot encounter certain exceptions
###### Attributes
#itcd/5-2
Information gathered on successive passes of the #AST 
- *Synthesised attributes* are passed up the tree
- *Inherited attributes* are passed down
information *synthesised* in one sub-tree may be *inherited* in another, or *synthesised* by the same sub-tree in a later pass
- One pass may *synthesise* symbol table while another uses it as *inherited* attribute
*Examples*

###### Environment
#itcd/5-3
build `vTable[id] = type` and `fTable[id] = (type, ..., type) -> type`
Instead of `vTable`, this can use type rules called *judgements*

#### Running The Check
#itcd/5-4 to #itcd/5-6
###### Expressions
#itcd/5-4
Book does it much like how it interpreted.
Error reporting returns instead of halting, to allow catching further type errors
- Later errors may be based on guesses from the first error, and as such can be wrong

###### Function Declarations & Program

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assignment                   | Check declared type during assignment<br>Relies on *non-structural information*<br>Done with *data-flow analysis*<br>- See #itcd/10                                                                        |
| Data structures              | Several components or union with different values at different times<br>- Type checker must internally represent the full structure somehow                                                                |
| Overloading                  | **NOTE:** many operators may be overloaded. Consider how to check this.<br>- If language cannot determine which to pick, throw "unresolved overloading" and make user cast                                 |
| Type conversion              | casting and/or int/double expressions like $3+3.12$<br>- Book does not elaborate, but if types are available, table of compatible conversions make it easy<br>  - This assumes it is known at compile time |
| Polymorphism / Generic Types | No tips given. See #itcd/12-1                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Implicit Types               | Using *type-inference*<br>- report type error if ambiguous or inconsistent<br>- Example language uses this for `let` expressions                                                                           |
