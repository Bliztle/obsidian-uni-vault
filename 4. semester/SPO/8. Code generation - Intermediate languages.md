- To be able to explain the role of intermediate code in a compiler
	- Common target to generate instructions from. Simplifies compilation and lowers amount of needed translators.
- To be able to carry out the steps needed to generate code for a given intermediate language in a syntax-directed fashion
- And in particular to do this for expressions, statements, arrays and declarations

## Intermediate Code Generation
#itcd/6
This lecture assumes intermediate language has no composite expressions. In our project, this is not the case.
#### Designing an Intermediate Language
#itcd/6-1 
- Intermediate languages reduces the total number of translators needed
- Optimization only has to be done once, from intermediate to machine instructions

Intermediate can be either high or low level
- Multiple intermediate can be used to ease this
#### The intermediate language
#itcd/6-2
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403183345.png)
#### Syntax-Directed Translation
#itcd/6-3
*Syntax-directed translation* is when translation steps closely follows the syntax of the language, with each syntax construct being translated to a target construct in the intermediate language.
- Each translation function may hold information about its context (fx symbol tables) and how it interfaces with it (which variables are used)
**Every parse rule has a translation function. Once all rules are implemented, **
#### Generating code from expressions
#itcd/6-4
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403185116.png)
- Whenever a new variable is needed, `newvar` generates a unique name
2 ways of passing information other than v/ftable
1. *locations* (variables) of values of subexpressions can be passed up as a synthesised attribute to parent, which decides on a *location* for its own value and returns this.
2. Parent can determine in which variables it wants to find its values, and pass these identifies / subexpressions down the tree
###### Method 1
Issue: 
- returns 6 instead of x+3 given `x+(x=3)` if `x` is *location* in both
	- Solved by copying value to a new variable whenever used
###### Method 2
Issue:
- `x=e` might store something in x while evaluating `e`, leading to overwrites or other issues
	- Create temp variables and assign to `x` in the end
###### Example
Uses method 1 for $Trans_{exps}$ and method 2 for $Trans_{exp}$
#itcd/6-4-1 contains examples

#### Translating statements
#itcd/6-5
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403190326.png)

Translating statements are done with $Trans_{Stat}$
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403190346.png)

Conditions are translated with $Trans_{Cond}$
- This works a lot like assembly loops, jumping if condition is true
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403190518.png)
#### Logical Operators
#itcd/6-6 
Two variants
1. Like arithmetic operators. Do not short-circuit
2. Short-circuits. Called *Sequential logical operators*
Using `-1` to represent truth means ! can be a bitwise operation, which is not the case with 1.

Using truthy values, **condition** is expanded to

###### Sequential logical operators
#itcd/6-6-1
Language is expanded with the following:

Evaluated with:

#### Advanced control statements
#itcd/6-7
- Goto and labels
	- map labels to labels in intermediate language. May require 2 passes
	- 1 pass is possible if stored when used and marked when declared, and checking it is only declared once
- Break, exit, and continue
	- $Trans_{Stat}$ should inherit an attribute with the a label after the most recently entered loop
	- continue is handled same way, with label at the beginning of the loop
- Switch case
	- Nested if-then-else
	- C-like with fallthrough requires labels after each and a jump
#### Translating structured data
#itcd/6-8
###### Floating-point values
#itcd/6-8-1
Handled like ints, but in special registers during execution. Should be marked as such with names or symbol tables
###### Arrays
#itcd/6-8-2
Extend language with
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403192815.png)
Like C. Allocate in stack if compiletime size known, heap otherwise.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403193017.png)
Multidimensional are done with offsets
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403193058.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020240403193111.png)
###### Strings
#itcd/6-8-3
May be an array of chars (C, Haskell), but may also differ
- In UTF-8, ASCII is 1 byte but others are up to 4
- Concat / substr is more common on string than other arrays
- Strings in many languages can be lexicographically compared to others, unlike other arrays
###### Records/Structs and unions
#itcd/6-8-4
Arrays with known subarrays for each part
#### Translation of declarations
Declared in the corresponding symbol table
- Arrays are start and maybe length. Can be declared as simply variables, with typechecking handling the rest.
- Structs/records are start and offsets, or start and type, with offsets stored in a definition elsewhere
	- #itcd only mentions first option
