## SLR Parsing
#itcd/2-13 ***S**imple **L**eft **R**ight Parsing - easier to rewrite formation rules to*
read LTR, with rightmost derivation

- Works with a DFA to select actions. 
- DFA is represented as a table, with actions listed as $xn$

Intuitively just reduce when possible, otherwise shift. *NOT THE ALGORITHM*

###### Algorithm and Table example

#### Constructing SLR parse tables
#itcd/2-14
1. Add starting state $T'$.
2. Create NFA's of each production
3. Combine and turn into DFA
4. Add extra starting state $T''\rightarrow T'$
5. Create parse table
	1. terminal is shift
	2. nonterminal is go
	3. If a DFA state contains an production $p : N\rightarrow \alpha$ NFA's accepting state, $FOLLOW(N)$ is $reduce\ p$
	4. reduction on $T'$ is accept
###### SLR Conflicts
- *shift-reduce conflict*: when a table entry has both
- *reduce-reduce conflict*: two or more reduces in entry
Often caused by ambiguous grammar, and can often be rewritten. No guarantee

the following is always a conflict:

## Precedence Rules
#itcd/2-15
Most LR generators allow setting precedence for infix operators
For *shift-reduce*, you can simply eliminate actions from the table, to decide which takes precedence
- For same priority, reduce shift for left-associativity, and reduce for right-associativity
	- Remove both for non-associativity
## Using LR-generator
#itcd/2-16
LALR(1) is an extended SLR used in practice, but not covered in the book
- SLR knowledge should be enough to use it

Generator may represent states as the following:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240306204515.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020240306204529.png)
*'.' is the state itself of the production*

(different) *actions* can be assigned to productions to translate a production to relevant term in code. Structural tokens can then be thrown out.
Grammar with removed left recursion may not look like the intended goal, and produce trees dissimilar to the original productions.
An imperative example:

with no left recursion becomes

## Properties of Context-Free languages
#itcd/2-17
- NFA and DFA do not cover the same CFL's
	- Different to regular languages, where NFA and DFA both cover all
- CFA can only keep count of track of at a time
	- $\{a^{n}b^{n}|n\geq0\}$ is possible
	- $\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}|n\geq0\}$ is not
	- $\{w^{*^{2}}|w\in\Sigma\}$ (concatenation) is not either
- Closed under
	- prefix
	- suffix
	- subsequence
	- reversal
- Not closed under
	- intersection
	- complement
		- $\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{m}|m,n\geq0\}\cup\{a^{m}b^{n}c^{n}|m,n\geq0\}$ is not a CFL, though both parts are
