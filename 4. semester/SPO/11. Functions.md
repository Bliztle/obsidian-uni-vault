## Functions #itcd/9 
*Register allocation & Translating functions to machine code*
#### The Call Stack #itcd/9/1
Store only registers for current function
- Rest goes on call stack
Other uses
- Spilled variables
	- Slightly more complicated than heap
	- But are already on stack when calling other method
- Parameters can be pushed on top
- Return address on stack
- Non-local variables
	- Outer scope or global
- Local arrays and records
#### Activation Records #itcd/9/2
*activation record / stack frame*
- Machine architecture dictates *calling convention*
Simple example, storing all call info in stack frame

#### Prologues, Epilogues, and Call-Sequences #itcd/9/3
*Pro- & epilogues wrap function to handle call / definition*
![](Pasted%20image%2020240423221824.png)
Calling is done with call-sequence, saving variabZles on stack

#### Callee Saved Registers #itcd/9/4
*Letting callee save registers before use*
- Stack frame

  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425125107.png)
- Prologue and epilogue
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240423222520.png) ![](Pasted%20image%2020240423222539.png)
- Call sequence
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240423222603.png)
#itcd/9/5 Mixing
- Caller saves live variables in caller-saved registers on stack (or moves to callee saved)
- Callee saves value of callee-saved registers before use
- Mixing allows neither to save in many cases
#itcd/9/6 shows strategy with pro, epi, and call-sequence

#### Interaction with Register Allocator #itcd/9/7
Variables live across call
- Saved in callee register
- If no callee register, spill to stack
	- Let other variables use caller registers

Good register allocation for compiling functions:
1. Generate code for body, with symbolic register names
	1. $\mathtt{RETURN}$ should set variables and jump to common epilogue
2. Add part of prologue for moving parameters from numbered registers and stack into named variables
3. Call register allocator with full function body and stack offset for spilled variables
	1. Allocator returns set of used callee registers, and number of spilled variables
4. Add rest of prologue and epilogue, saving and restoring registers used by allocator
5. Add function label and final return jump
#### Local Variables #itcd/9/8 
Store arrays on stack
- Preallocate size if known at compiletime
- Otherwise put address (offset from SP) in register, and allocate runtime
- Last option: Array is both offset, size, data on stack
#### Non-local Variables #itcd/9/9
Global variables
- Stored on known address, compiled into instructions
- Loaded into register before use
- Stored before function call, as function may access it
- Stored at end of function
- If references to variable could be included in parameter to current function, it has to be stored immediatly after any use.
###### Call-by-Reference Parameters #itcd/9/9/2
Passing address
- Possibly used for return
- Slower, as it has to be read from #heap
#### Function as Parameters #itcd/9/10
Pass pointer to function
- $\texttt{CALL}$ instruction may not support non-hardcoded address
- Insert manual $\texttt{JUMP}$ after storing return address on stack
#### Optimisations for Function Calls #itcd/9/12
Different ways of optimising calls
###### Inlining #itcd/9/12/1 
Put function body into caller function
1. Rename local variables in caller - Like mangling to avoid collision
2. Copy called function and rename its variables
3. Replace call with declaration of arguments and function body
4. Remove callee, as it is not needed
Clashes if not renamed are called *Variable Capture*

May cost more than saved if much spilling ocours
###### Tail-Call Optimisation #itcd/9/12/2 
*Replacing* $\texttt{CALL RETURN}$ *with* $\texttt{GOTO}$ (But not so simple)

###### Tail-Recursion Optimisation
![](Pasted%20image%2020240423232831.png)
All recursion can become tail recursion
