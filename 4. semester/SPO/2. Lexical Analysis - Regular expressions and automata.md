#itcd/1 
Learning goals
- To be able to explain the role of lexical analysis in the implementation of a programming language
	- Finding the words of a text
- To be able to use the basic terminology for lexical analysis correctly
- To be able to write a correct regular expression that specifies a given language
- To be able to construct an equivalent NFA from a regular expression
- To be able to explain the method used for constructing an NFA from a regular expression

## Regular Expressions
#itcd/1-1   

|  | Notation | Style |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Name of regexp | *r, s and t* | *Italics* |
| Letter in regex<br>Refers to the letter itself | s | typewriter (though these notes don't follow) |
| Unspecified single string | *u, v and w* | *Italics* |

Derivation of regular expressions is both reflexive and transitive

## Rewrite Rules
SPO uses rewrite rules for producing strings from regular expressions, substituting expressions for values or other expressions

| Notation used here | Name | Rewrite rules | In Sipser's book |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $a$ | Symbol |  | $a$ |
| $\epsilon$ | The language of the empty string |  | $\epsilon$ |
|  | The empty language |  | $Ã˜$ |
| $r_{1}\mid r_{2}$ | Choice | $r_{1}\mid r_{2}\Rightarrow r_{1}$<br>$r_{1}\mid r_{2}\Rightarrow r_{2}$ | $r_{1}\cup r_{2}$ |
| $r_{1}r_{2}$ | Concatenation | $r_1 r_2 \Rightarrow r'_1 r_2$<br>whenever $r_1 \Rightarrow r'_1$ | $r_1 \circ r_2$ |
| $r*$ | Star | $r*\Rightarrow rr*$<br>$r^* \Rightarrow\epsilon$ | $r^*$ |
## NFA Notation
SPO uses different symbols and order for the formal NFA definition
$(\Sigma, S, s_{0},F,T)$
- $\sum$ is an *alphabet*
- $S$ is the set of *states*
- $s_{0}\in S$ is the *start state*
- $F\subseteq S$ is the set of *accept states*
- $T\subseteq S\times(\Sigma\cup\{\epsilon\})\times S$ is the *transition relation*
T is a relation, not a function, as it may have multiple results or none at all

Any one transition:
$s\stackrel{a}{\rightarrow} t$
