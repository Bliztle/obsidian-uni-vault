## Register Allocation

|            | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Spilling* | Storing variable in memory, because there are not enough registers |
Allocation may be done in intermediate or machine language
- In machine, use placeholders in generation and replace in 2nd pass
- Intermediate handles directly
	- Allocation is independent of architecture - Only done once
	- May miss optimisations where instructions can be combined, removing a variable
#### Liveness
#itcd/8/1 *variable is dead if it will not be used later. Alive before*
Share register if not alive at the same time
Determining liveness:
1. If an instruction uses it, it is alive at the start of that instruction
2. If a variable is assigned by instruction, and not used as operant, it is *dead* at the start of that instruction
	1. As its value is not relevant
3. If it is alive at the end, and not assigned to during, it is alive at the start
4. Alive at end if live at the start of an succeeding instruction
1 is *generation*, 2 is *killed*, 3 and 4 is how liveness is *propogated*
#### Liveness analysis
#itcd/8/2 
finding $succ[i]$, the set of *successors* of instruction $i$
1. if $i$ does not change flow ($\texttt{GOTO, IF-THEN-ELSE, RETURN}$) then $succ[i]=\{i+1\}$
2. if $i$ is $\texttt{GOTO }l$ then $succ[i]=j$ for instruction $j:\texttt{LABEL }l$ 
3. if $i$ is $\texttt{IF } c \texttt{ THEN }l_{t} \texttt{ ELSE } l_{f}$ then $succ[i]=\{j, k\}$ for instruction $j:\texttt{LABEL }l_{t}$, $k:\texttt{LABEL }l_{f}$ 
4. if $i$ is $\texttt{RETURN }x$ then $succ[i]=Ã˜$

Requires $\texttt{RETURN}$ to end all functions. If not present, insert it.

###### GEN, KILL, IN, & OUT
- $gen[i]$ - Variables which may be read, hence are live
- $kill[i]$ - Variables written to by instruction
- $in[i]$ - Variables live at the start of $i$
	- If a variable is live at the start of a function, it may be used before declared
- $out[i]$ - Variables live at the end of $i$

$in$ & $out$ are recursively defined, solved with fixed-point iteration
- $in[i]=gen[i]\cup(out[i] \setminus kill[i])$
- $out[i]=\bigcup\limits_{j\in succ[i]}in[j]$
calculate from last instruction to first, $out$ before $in$
- $out[14], in[14], out[13], in[13], \dots, out[1], in[1]$

#### Interference
#itcd/8/3 
$x$ interferes with $y$ if $x\neq y$ and $\exists i\ .\ x\in kill[i]\land y\in out[i]\land i\text{ is not } x:=y$
- Share register if not interfering
- Not the same as live at the same time
	- After $x:=y$, they may share as they have the same value
	- Assigning to $x$ and never using it again
		- $x\notin out[i]$ even if $x\in kill[i]$
		- Prevents overwriting $y$ by assigning $x$
Is *symmetric*, even if definition is not
- Conclusion is symmetric
- *interference graph* shows all interference
#### Register allocation by graph colouring
#itcd/8/4 #NP *Nodes can share if they are not connected in interference graph*
1. Connected nodes have different registers
2. Amount of register numbers cannot be higher than available registers

*Graph coloring* is an #NP-hard problem
1. If a node has strictly fewer than $N$ edges, set it aside and color the rest of the graph
	1. Since there will always be a register left (if possible)
2. Remaining (max $N-1$) nodes connected to selected node are coloured with colours not used by neighbours

Algorithm for trying even when no nodes have less than $N$ edges:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240417183929.png)
#### Spilling
#itcd/8/5
Nodes not coloured in graph are *spilled*
1. Choose address $address_{x}$, either constant or constant offset from stack top or frame pointer
2. rename $x$ to $x_{i}$ in instructions
3. Before read $x$, insert instruction $x_{i}:=M[address_{x}]$
4. After assign $x$, insert instruction $M[address_{x}]:=x_{i}$
5. If $x$ is an input parameter, start function with $M[address_{x}]:=x$

Then start register allocation over again
#### Heuristics
#itcd/8/6 *heuristics for **simplify** in algorithm 8.3*

Assign weights to below, and calculate:
- Chose node with close to $N$ neighbours. This may be colourable, if two neighbours share a colour
- Choose node with many close-to-$N$ neighbours. Spilling this may allow colouring the others.
- Look at program and choose one which is cheap to spill
	- One not used in loop

Choose colour already in use
- Always use lowest numbered available colour
Or more advanced
- Count colours in distance 2 from node, and use most used available colour
###### Removing redundant moves
#itcd/8/6/1 *Removing instructions or changing colours*
- $x:=y$ can be removed if they use the same register
- *Biased colouring* - Give $y$ same colour as $x$ as long as $y$ does not interfere with that colour (including $x$)
- *Coalescing* - Combining $x, y$ in graph if they do not interfere
	- Have to split again if **simplify** cannot find node less than $N$
- *Live-range splitting* - Reverse *coalescing*. Splitting a variable and inserting assignments
	- Usually more effective than loading from memory
###### Using explicit register numbers
#itcd/8/6/2 
Some instructions may require specific registers. Then *pre-colour* nodes.
- *live-range splitting* may be used to avoid *pre-colour*, by assigning before and after instruction
