- To be able to explain the role of machine code in a compiler
- To be able to explain the role of registers and conditional jumps
- To be able to carry out the steps needed to generate machine code from intermediate code in a syntax-directed fashion
## Machine-Code Generation
#itcd/7
Uses machine language #MIPS (*Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages*)
Assume simple von Neumann

#### Conditional Jumps
#itcd/7-1
`IF-THEN-ELSE` jumps to given labels.
```asm
CMP ;insert comparison
branch_if_c ; conditional jump
; jump otherwise excluded, as generated code can place it right after.
```
#### Constants
#itcd/7-2
Often have sizes not directly supported. Have to loaded into different parts of a register with multiple commands.

#### Exploiting complex instructions
#itcd/7-3
*Complex Instruction Set Computer* #CISC like #x86-64 have many non-atomic composite instructions.
*Reduced Instruction Set Computer* #RISC like #ARM does not, only a few. Likely for memory addressing.
Even in #RISC:
```
t2 := t1 + 116
t3 := M[t2]
```
becomes
```
lw x3, 116(x1) // This chapter has not introduced registers. Uses t1=x1 t3=x3
```

- *Patterns* describe sequence of intermediate-code instructions
- *Patterns* turn into *replacements*
```
t := rs + k
r1 := M[t_last]
-----------
lw r1, k(t_last)
```
*Replacements* are done greedily here, eating as much of the *pattern* as possible
- Not always optimal, but simple
**IMPORTANT**

#### Optimisations
#itcd/7-4
Done in 3 places
1. Source code
2. Intermediate code
3. Machine code
Intermediate language lets all compilers benefit from it.
