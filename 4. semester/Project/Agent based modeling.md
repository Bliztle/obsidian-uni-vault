Made of parts
1. the social structure within which an agent is placed
2. a mechanism that describes how social structure impacts individual agents at the micro level
3. the agents, with their perceptions and decision-making capacity
4. a mechanism providing for how agents choose their actions
5. the actions chosen
6. a transformational mechanism that describes how the agentsâ€™ behavior at the micro level influences the macro structure
7. the updated macro level as the explanandum.
