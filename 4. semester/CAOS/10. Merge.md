All pages are allocated on disk, with #DRAM simply acting as a large cache for those pages

for #TLB, translate #VA to #TLB tag #TLBT and #TLB index #TLBI
- #TLBI matches the *set* in the #TLB 
- #TLBT matches the *tag* in the set row of the #TLB
#TLBI takes however many bits are required to match the amount of sets in #TLB 
- #TLBT takes the rest
