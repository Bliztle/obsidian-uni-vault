1. Insert in-between c and d
	1. Latency is $80+30+60+20+50+70+10+20=340$
	2. Throughput is $\frac{1}{170+20 ps}*1000(unit)=5.26GIPS$
2. between b-c and d-e
	1. latency is $340+20=360ps$
	2. Throughput is $\frac{1}{110+20 ps}*1000(unit)=7.69GIPS$
3. between a-b, c-d, d-e
	1. latency is $360+20=380ps$
	2. Throughput is $\frac{1}{90+20 ps}*1000(unit)=9.09GIPS$
4. insert 4 registers for 5 stages, as we need to reduce all stages to a maximum of 80ps
	1. a-b-c-d-ef
	2. latency is $380+20=400ps$
	3. Throughput is $\frac{1}{80+20 ps}*1000(unit)=10.0GIPS$

both become 0

1. 2n of each
2. The multiplication on line 8 cannot be pipelined with the next cycle, and takes 5 cycles to perform

1. n multiplications and 2n additions/subtractions
2. The addition which takes 3 cycles depends on the multiplication with 5 cycles, and these operations cannot be pipelined
3. Multiplications and additions in 5.5 can be run in parallel, while 5.6 cannot

```c
for (i = 0; i < limit; i += 5) {
	// Bad slow approach
	acc = (((((acc OP data[i]) OP data[i+1]) OP data[i+2]) OP data[i+3]) OP data[i+4]);
	// Floating point math is not technically associative, but here we go
	acc = (acc OP data[i]) OP (data[i+1] OP data[i+2]) OP (data[i+3] OP data[i+4]);
