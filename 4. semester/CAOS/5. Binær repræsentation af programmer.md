#cspp/3-7

3 aspects to any procedure

|                | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stack frame    | space on stack used when registers are full                            |
| leaf procedure | One which does not call other procedures. Often take no space on stack |

Local variables are allocated by decrementing the stack pointer (or pushing to stack). Used when space is needed or c-operator `&` is required to pass a reference.
## Combining Control and Data in Machine-Level Programs
#cspp/3-10
Remote code execution through buffer overflow attacks work because ret pointer can be overridden, pointing to malicious code instead, also written in the attack. Works because code and data are essentially the same on the stack.
- Defenses
	- Stack randomisation
		- Allocation n bytes at the start of the program to offset stack pointer.
			- Attacked with `nop` (no-op) instructions, giving larger attack surface
	- Stack Corruption detection
		- places *canary* values on stack, to check for corruption
		- Random value each execution
			- `movq fs:40 %rsp` to store canary on stack
	- Limiting Executable Regions
		- Not all memory has to be executable
		- Works in conjunction with hardware *pages* in memory (2048 or 4096 byte blocks)
