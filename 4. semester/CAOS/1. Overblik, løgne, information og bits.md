## Compiler driver
#cspp/1-2
`gcc` is a compiler driver, which drives the compilation process

## Hardware organisation
#cspp/1-4 

|  | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Bus | Carries word-sized information between components |
| ALU | Arithmetic / Logic Unit<br>Performs calculations on words |
| Processor | Simplified works with 4 instructions<br><br>*Load*: copy byte or word to register<br>*Store*: copy byte or word from register to memory<br>*Operate*: copy 2 registers to ALU, perform operations and store result in register<br>*Jump*: |
#cspp/1-5
Cache tiers seen below. Most CPU time is spend moving data, which caches speed up.

| Cache     | Size          |
| --------- | ------------- |
| #cache/L1 | 10's of kb    |
| #cache/L2 | possibly a mb |
| #cache/L3 | ???           |

## Operation Systems
#cspp/1-7
Abstraction on the hardware protecting the hardware and ensuring stable interface regardless of architecture.

Processes perform given instructions, and the kernel may use context switching to interrupt a process or switch process while waiting to minimise downtime. Each process "sees" a complete system, unaware of each other.

## Concurrency
#cspp/1-9

|  | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Concurrency | Doing multiple things at once |
| Parallelism | The use of concurrency to improve performance |

**Thread-Level Concurrency**
*Executing threads simultaneously on multiple CPUs*
May use #hyperthreading with multiple program counters and register files per CPU, to switch thread on same cpu in a single clock cycle instead of 20.000

*Intel Core i7 chip*

**Instruction-Level Parallelism**
*Superscalar CPUs* may perform 2-4 (up to 100) instructions in a single cycle by delegating to different subparts

**Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) Parallelism**
Performing the same instruction on multiple datasets at once.
- Scalars make this easy for the cpu, performing an operation on each element at the same time

## Information Storage
Some C data types change size based on word size

**Endian**
Little endian stores least significant **byte** first, big endian stores most significant first.
- Little has to be read in reverse byte order, though each byte is read RTL
- Network traffic uses big endian, while most systems use little endian.
