## Condition Variables & Synchronization #ostep/30 
*Waiting for a thread to finish a certain task*
DBs not covered
- Follow #ACID
	- **A**tomicity
	- **C**onsitency
	- **I**solation
	- **D**urability
#### Definition and Routines #ostep/30/1
using *condition variables*
- queue with threads waiting
- Signal thread to wake

```c
int done = 0;
pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t c = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

void thr_exit() {
Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
done = 1;
Pthread_cond_signal(&c);
Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}

void *child(void *arg) {
printf("child\n");
thr_exit();
return NULL;
}

void thr_join() {
Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
while (done == 0)
Pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
printf("parent: begin\n");
pthread_t p;
Pthread_create(&p, NULL, child, NULL);
thr_join();
printf("parent: end\n");
return 0;
}
```
#### Producer / Consumer Problem #ostep/30/2
*Also known as the Bounded Buffer problem*
- Producer adding to buffer
- Consumer taking from buffer
Simple case is handled with a lock and condition
- Multiple consumers need more though, as a consumer might take from buffer before producer has signalled an already sleeping consumer
- Producer signals state, but when consumer wakes, the state may have changed.
- Alternatively, a waked consumer may *with only a single condition* wake another consumer, leading to all threads sleeping

#### Covering Conditions #ostep/30/3
They create a heap, where threads wait for the space they want to allocate to be free

## Semaphores #ostep/31 
*Primitives for synchonization* #ostep/31/1

- counts how many threads are allowed access at a time
###### Binary Semaphores (Locks) #ostep/31/2
Using with value 1, allowing a single thread

#### Semaphores for ordering #ostep/31/2
Example waiting for child. Waits for $X+1$ threads

###### Producer / Consumer again #ostep/31/4
![](Pasted%20image%2020240430204921.png)
#### Reader-Writer locks #ostep/31/5
Allowing many readers, single writer, and locking while writing
![](Pasted%20image%2020240430205340.png)
#### Building Sempahores (Zemaphores) #ostep/31/8
- Like linux, these do not count negative with amount of waiting threads

## Common Concurrency Problems #ostep/32
read #ostep/32
![](Pasted%20image%2020240501094126.png)
- Global wait avoided with global ordering of ressources (*total orden*)
	- Resource x always have to be locked before y
- Causes slowdown as one ressource may be locked for longer than others, but doesn't deadlock
