- Only `%rsp` has special meaning
- Uses virtual memory #VM
###### Instructions
#cspp/4-1-2
- Only 8-byte integers
- `movq` split in 4, indicating src/dest
	- immediate (i), register (r), memory (m)
- `cmov` is conditional `rrmovq`
- `halt` stops all execution, like exceptions.

- `pushq %rsp` both decrements pointer and pushes its value. Y follows X, which decrements first

major elements

2. memory elements
3. clock signals

###### Combinational Circuits
#cspp/4-2-2
Restrictions
1. Every gate must be connected to exactly one of
	1. system input / primary input
	2. output of a memory element
	3. output of another logic gate
2. two outputs cannot be directly connected
3. Must be *acyclic*. No loops anywhere, due to ambiguity.
Can be expressed in c-like syntax, though it is not considered an assignment
`{c}bool eq = (a && b) || (!a && !b)`

Word level operations can be expressed like

###### Memory and clocking
- *Clocked registers*
	- Stores individual bits / words. Controls loading of registers with value at its input
 - *Random access memories*
	 - virtual memory #VM( #RAM)
	 - the usual registers

- setting `srcA=3` reads `%rbx` and outputs at `valA`

## Sequential Y86-64 Implementations
#cspp/4-3
Processing in 6 stages
1. Fetch
	1. Fetch instruction at PC
		1. extract first byte (icode | ifun)
	2. Possibly fetch register bytes `rA`, `rB`
	3. Possibly fetch 8-byte const `valC`
	4. compute `valP` as `PC` + length of current instruction
2. Decode
	1. Reads values `valA`, `valB` from register file. Often `rA`, `rB`, but might be `%rsp`
3. Execute
	1. ALU does operation. Result is `valE`
	2. could be stack pointer change or lea computation as well
4. Memory
	1. May read or write memory. Read value is `valM`
5. Write back
	1. Write up to 2 results to register file
6. PC update
