## Overview
#ostep/15
Focus on *limited direct execution* #LDE 
- Let program run directly on hardware
- Interrupt at certain times (e.g. on interrupt) to ensure the correct thing happens
- OS gets out of the way, but controls everything
Virtual memory #VM has similar goals
- Attain efficiency and control while providing virtualisation
- Create illusion of single continuous memory space

Uses *Hardware-based address translation*
- Translate vAddress to physical address #PA
- OS manages and sets up, before HW can translate
- Handled by *memory management unit* #MMU

## Virtual Memory
#cspp/9 #VM *is central, powerful, and dangerous*
Main memory is contiguous byte-size cells, each with a *physical address* #PA 
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416182835.png)

#cspp/9/2 *set of non-negative integer addresses*
- Virtual Address #VA space #VAS - Linear address space
- Physical address #PA space #PAS - nonlinear

#### #VM for #cache
Like other caches, #VM is partitioned into blocks called *virtual pages* #VP
- Each #VP is $P=2^{p}$ bytes
Physical memory partitioned same way in *physical pages* #PP
- Also $P$ bytes
Each #VP is part of one of 3 sets
- *Unallocated* - No data, not allocated by #VM system ( #MMU)
- *Cached* - Currently cached in physical memory 
- *Uncached* - Allocated but not in physical memory

#DRAM miss is expensive (100.000x), #VP's are large and fully associative
###### Page table #PT
#cspp/9/3/2
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416184305.png)
Array of *page table entries* #PTE 
- Each #PTE corresponds to a #VP with address of where in #DRAM #PP to find it if valid.
- Example has 4 #PP for 8 #VP
- When reading, if *valid* is 1, deference #PP address
- on *page fault*, trigger exception and let kernel fetch
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416185053.png)
#locality makes it efficient. The active pages (or *working set / resident set*) stays the same for long.
#### #VM for memory
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416185707.png)
Reasons for using #VM other than larger memory space #cspp/9/4
- Simplifying linking
- Simplifying loading - Mark #VP invalid and let system load from file
- Simplifying sharing - Sharing memory between processes by pointing to the same #PP
- Simplifying memory allocation - Easy to allocate non-contiguous memory
For security #cspp/9/5
- Simply do not make #PTE pointing to off-limits memory
- Add access rights bits to #PTE with what the process is allowed to do

## Address Translation
#cspp/9/5 *A mapping from N-element* #VAS *to M-element* #PAS
$MAP:VAS\rightarrow PAS\cup Ø$
$MAP(A)=\begin{cases}A' &\text{if data at VA }A \text{ are present at PA }A'\text{in PAS}\\ Ø&\text{if data at VA }A \text{ are not in physical memory }\end{cases}$

Symbols used:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416191803.png)

- #CPU register *page table base register* #PTBR points to current #PT
- #VA split into *virtual page number* #VPN and *virtual page offset* #VPO
- #VPN indexes #PT 1-to-1, and the read *physical page number* #PPN is concattenated with *physical page offset* #PPO (The same as #VPO, as they are the same size) to form #PA

Data retrieval
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416192843.png)
#cache/L1 may be between #MMU and other, cached by #PA
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416193224.png)
###### Translation lookaside buffer #TLB
#cspp/9/6/2 
if #PTE is not in #cache/L1 cycles are wasted
- Even #cache/L1 may not be fast enough
![](Pasted%20image%2020240416194015.png)
###### Multi-Level Page Tables
#cspp/9/6/3 *Binary search for* #PTE
#PT is very large (4mb), and thus slow
- Hierarchical #PT's allow faster lookup
- Still slow, but saved by #TLB
