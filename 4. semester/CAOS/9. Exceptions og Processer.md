## Exceptional Control Flow

#cspp/8
_Flow of control_ / _control flow_ is a sequence $a_{0}, a_{1},\dots, a_{n-1}$ of _control transfers_ $a_{n-1}\rightarrow a_{n}$ changing the address of the program counter #PC

- _Smooth_ transitions increment to neighbouring instruction address
  _Exceptional control flow_ #ECF are transfers interrupting the current execution
- Incoming network request, hardware clock interval, sleeping.
- Happens at all levels. Hardware, OS, Runtime, Application code, metaphorically the developers operating in a different pattern

#### Exceptions

#cspp/8-1 _abrupt change in control flow, in response to change in processor state_
partly implemented in hardware, partly in OS.

- Change in state is an _event_
- On _event_, indirect call is made through through jump table _exception table_ to _exception handler_ (OS subrutine)
- One of 3 results 1. Handler returns control to current instruction $I_{curr}$ 2. Handler returns control to next instruction $I_{next}$ 3. Handler aborts the interrupted program

Each unique type of exception is assigned an _exception number (uint)_. Some by designer of #CPU, others by designers of OS #kernel.

- _exception table_ assigned on boot. Trap part may be referenced as _trap table_ #ostep/6/2
- start is _exception table base register_
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240409165705.png)
  Differences from procedure call:
- Current address is pushed on stack, but may be next instruction instead
- Additional information is pushed, like #x86-64 EFLAGS register
- If control is transfered to #kernel, it is instead pushed to #kernel stack
- Handlers run in #kernel mode, with full system access.
  After trigger, rest is handled by software

###### Classes of Exceptions

#cspp/8-1-2
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409170130.png)
The triggering exception is the _faulting exception_ (but not necessarily a _fault_ exception)
Handling an exception:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409170401.png) ![](Pasted%20image%2020240409170811.png)

- _Interrupt_ - see figure 8.5
- _Trap_ - making a system call and passing control to #kernel. Fx `read`, `fork` (new process), `execve` (`exec` on #UNIX #ostep/4) or `exit`.
  - Done with `syscall n` where `n` indicates which instruction
- _Fault_ - Fx _page fault exception_, where virtual address #VA referenced is not in a loaded page, and must be fetched from desk #SWAP
  - Paging is fx because programs are loaded lazily, so not all is read initially from disk.
- _Abort_ - Unrecoverable, fatal errors, such as #DRAM #SRAM bits being corrupted

###### Linux / x86-64 exceptions

#cspp/8-1-3 #linux #x86-64

###### System calls

_syscalls_ or _system-level functions_
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409171310.png)
All arguments on #linux are passed with syscall number on `%rax` and args on `%rdi - %r9` in order
![](Pasted%20image%2020240410085850.png)
`int* status` in `wait` is a return value, from the corresponding `exit(int status)` call.
Running new code on other process is possible with `{c}pid_t pid = fork(); if (pid == 0) exec(/* File */);`

![](Pasted%20image%2020240410090012.png)
Children get pid 0 from `fork()`

#### Processes

#cspp/8/2 _an instance of a program in execution_

- Intedepent control flow
- Private address space

###### Logical control flow

#cspp/8/2/1
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409172057.png)
Process being temporarily suspended is _preempted_
#concurrency is processes running at the same time. BC does not, as B completes before C starts.

- _time slicing_ divides cpu time
  #parallel flows are running at the same time on different CPUs, without _time slicing_ each other.
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240409175107.png) ![](Pasted%20image%2020240409175142.png)
  #ostep/4 Process states are running / ready / blocked (and new / terminated)
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240410085354.png)
  One possible simple implementation uses linked lists of states
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240410093209.png)

###### Private Address Space

begins at `0x400000` above which is kernel code
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409172537.png)
_mode bit_ on means running in #kernel mode, with all privileges.
on #linux, kernel info is in `/proc/*process-id*`

###### Context Switches

#cspp/8/2/5 _higher level exceptional control flow for context switching_

- _preempting_ decisions are made by _scheduler_ doing _context switching_ 1. Save current context 2. restore save context of previous process 3. pass control to restored process
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240409173331.png)

#### Execution

#ostep/6
Problems:

1. Restricted operations (i.e. I/O)
   1. Solved with limited direct execution #LDE
2. Switching between processes
   1. Give OS with scheduler control. OS has timed interval interrupt where it takes control in exception table, and decides course.

###### Direct execution

#ostep/6/1 _directly executing on the cpu_
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409183709.png)
Cannot perform restricted operations (i.e. I/O)

###### Limited direct execution

#ostep/6/2
![](Pasted%20image%2020240409184258.png)

###### Timer interrupt

![](Pasted%20image%2020240409184558.png)

###### Concurrency

#ostep/6/4 _what if timer interrupt happens during a syscall (i.e. interrupt in interrupt)_
lock / queue, or system might simply disable during interrupts (though dangerous).
