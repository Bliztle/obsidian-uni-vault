## Exceptions
Exceptions should make sense to the caller. If the internals of a class throws an exception, caller should be aware, and exception should likely be custom.
> Let the caller handle abnormal conditions
> 		Consider throwing exceptions instead of handling logic

use `throws Exception` to allow caller to decide what to do, if inner function doesn't have the information to know what to do.

`RuntimeException`s are optional in throws, subtypes of `Exception` have to be added.
- Not writing `throws` indicates caller doesn't have to handle it

Checked exceptions should remain stable in development.
- Cannot add checked exceptions when overriding functions

Try with resources is possible with `java.lang.Autoclosable` (C# using)

## Assertions
Throws `AssertionError`

```java
assert boolean : "Error message to print";
```

Assertions only work when enabled - Testing
-ea to enable with java in cli
`{sh} java -ea -cp class <name-of-class>`

Can be used at start and end of methods to ensure class invariance always holds
