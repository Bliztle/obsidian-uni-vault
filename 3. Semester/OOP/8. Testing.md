Black box vs white box
- Testing from requirements on the outside, not seeing code
- Seeing code and testing known edge cases, testing all lines

Junit
@beforeEach
@test
Assertions.assertNull(Object) // Or something like that

### White box
Look at branching paths and find all combinations

### Exceptions
Testing for exceptions can be done with the executable interface

### Integration testing
Unit lifetime is longer than the test - ensures everything works afterwards

All-bindings covering criteria
- Inherited methods must be tested
- Test for late binding, making sure all versions work
If we test on a generalisation, make sure all possible bindings are tested

- Make sure that every object that is created or updated is tested for all their possible uses through the program

Write tables to determine 

When there are interceptions between one functions defs and another ones uses, the pair should be tested
