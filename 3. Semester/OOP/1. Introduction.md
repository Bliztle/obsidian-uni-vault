# 1 Programming Concepts
## Paradigms
*A programming paradigm is a way of conceptualizing what it means to perform computation, and how tasks that are to be carried out on a computer should be structured and organized.*
- Imperative
- Procedural
- Declarative
- Functional
- Logic
- Object-oriented

Java does not have {get; set;} syntax :(
WORA does stuff well

|           |                            |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Function  | No side-effects            |
| Method    | Describes object behaviour |
| Procedure | With side-effects          | 
## OOP and Java
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Good decomposition (separation of concern) gives:
- Simplicity
- Isolation
- Maintainability
Done with abstraction, with each part only focusing on what is relevant to them.

Parameters are called *abstraction by parameterization*

**ALWAYS USE PRIVATE STATE**

## Data Abstraction
Data type has 3 components
- A set of values or data object
- A set of operations that can be applied to the values
- A data representation, determining how data is stored

```java
public class Person {
	// Date representation
	private String[] data = new String[2];
	public Person(String initialName, String initialGender) {
		data[0] = initialName;
		data[1] = initialGender;
	}
	// Operations
	public String getName() {
		return data[0];
	}
	public void setName(String newName) {
		data[0] = newName;
	}
	public String getGender() {
		return data[1];
	}
}
```

## Encapsulation
- Class
- Package - Collection of uniquely named classes
- Module - Collection of packages. Can define what is exported
- Compilation unit - DLL

`public` changes level of encapsulation

If a class has only state and accessors, something is wrong. This means behaviour is defined elsewhere.

## Inheritance
You know

## Polymorphism
Take on different shapes in different contexts
- Ad hoc polymorphism
	- Overloading - Shares method name
	- Coercion - Relies on implicit cast
- Universal polymorphism - Inclusion / Parametric
	- Inclusion - Subclass / classes which inherit or implements interface
	- Parametric - `<T>`
