#### Creational patterns
- \*Factory
- Builder

Patterns should be used with consideration.

| Lazy initialization | getX creates the object the first time, instead of on startup |

- Open/Closed
	- think about new requirements. That may change the interfaces in the future.
	- Adding to a list of if/else statements based on a new allowed input also breaks this principle
- Using rest parameters apparently doesn't break any of these????
## Singleton Pattern

> Definition: Ensures a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

- Once created, all uses involve the same instance
- private constructor to prevent "new" keyword - Also stops inheritance. + make it final.
- Take care of thread safety. "synchronised" keyword to force threads to wait.

Multiple methods exist for lazy initialization - JavaFundamentals p 13 ish
- Synchronized null check
- Nested class
- Double-checked locking - Nested synchronized for less overhead
## Prototype Pattern

> Definition: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype

Creating new objects is expensive. Cloning is faster, saving time and money.
Do complicated or long process once, clone for other uses.

Nano and Ford are made with BasicCar.get().clone()

- Needs to implement clone on all subclasses. Deepcopies can be expensive.

## Builder Pattern

> Definition: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations

Director class methods on the builder interface, making ConcreteBuilder add parts, and finally create Product in the end.
There can be multiple different ConcreteBuilders, so i.e. car and motorcycle both implement Builder.

- Create complex objects step by step, possibly varying the steps
- Not suitable for mutable objects. Product is considered final
- `builder` could be an abstract class if it makes sense
- Methods usually return the ConcreteBuilder to allow chaining syntax

## Factory Method Pattern

> Definition: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Book says nothing non-trivial. Class Animal has abstract createAnimal. DogFactory has createAnimal -> dog.
