Behavioral patterns
- Observer Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Visitor Pattern

## Observer pattern
*notifies many subscribers of one change*

Observer interface exposes notification function.

## Command Pattern
*Parameterises clients with requests, queues, or log requests - Can undo*
Has 4 parts

| Part     | Explanation                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoker  | Invokes the command for the client, hiding how its performed              |
| Client   | Holds invoker and commands, passing commands to invoker                                                                          |
| Command  | A set of actions for receiver to perform                                  |
| Reciever | Invoked by the command in a receiver-specific way, processing the actions |

Client creates commands for each action it will perform, passing the receiver (game) to the commands. Invoker (RemoteControlInvoker) then executes the command, with the option to undo it again.

## Strategy Pattern
*Lets algorithms vary independent of the client using them*
![](Pasted%20image%2020231115182227.png)
Client makes vehicle and supervisor, before adding behaviour. Vehicle and behaviour are never directly connected.
Allows client to decide behaviour at runtime

Lecture has a good example of using this to sort a catalog in different ways, with each way defined as a strategy, removing and readding each course.

**NOT TEMPLATE PATTERN**
- Strategy can vary the steps, by letting the client decide to call behaviour (strategy). Template can only vary the implementation of each steps

## Visitor Pattern
*adds operations without modifying class it operates on. Separates algorithm from object structure.*
Good for apis supporting plug-ins. Common in structures with multiple nodes.
Visiting objects one-by-one, objects accept visitor, and allow visitor to perform operations
```java
public void acceptMethod(Visitor visitor) {
	visitor.specificVisitorMethod(this)
}
```
Example checks employees for promotion eligibility, with visitor knowing criteria for junior and senior teachers, checking the teacher's yoe.
Using this pattern, new visitors with new criteria can be created, with employees knowing what to call on visitor.
