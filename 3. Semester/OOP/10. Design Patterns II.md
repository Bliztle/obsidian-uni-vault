Excluding builder, these are structural patterns

### Builder Pattern
See [9. Design Patterns I](9.%20Design%20Patterns%20I.md)

### Decorator Pattern
*Solves diamond problem - Extends without modifying*
Wrap class in decorator class, containing wrapped as an attribute. Chain for multiple decorators.
**Decorator object explicitly defers operations to decorated object, modifying as needed**

```java
// Advanced home with two pools and a playground
Home home = new AdvancedHome();
home = new Playground(home);
home = new SwimmingPool(home);
home = new SwimmingPool(home);
System.out.println("Home price is " + home.getPrice());
```
### Adapter Pattern
*Converts interface to other interface - Lets classes work with incompatible interfaces*
wrap class of one interface to rename methods to other interface
**Interface adapter shown below. Class adapter equivalent exists to support multiple inheritance**

### Composite Pattern
*Composes objects into trees - Client treats individual or composite objects equally*
Just objects having other objects. Example is Senior teachers having junior teachers. Junior teachers can be used on their own, or as part of senior.
**Objects have to implement the same interface to be treated uniformly**
### Template Method Pattern
*Lets subclasses define substeps of algorithm*
abstract class with final function invoking abstract function, defined by inheritor.
