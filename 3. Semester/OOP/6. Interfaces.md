- What interfaces are
- How to declare interfaces - see syntax
- How to declare abstract, default, private, and static methods in interfaces - see block below
- How to fully and partially implement interfaces in a class - partial by implementing on abstract class
- How to evolve interfaces after they are published - see defaults
- How to inherit an interface from other interfaces - extends
- Using the instanceof operator with interfaces - Checks if interface is implemented
- What marker interfaces are - Empty interfaces used like branded types
- How interfaces can be used to implement polymorphism - objects can be viewed as their type or any interface type, giving access to different things.
- How dynamic binding applies to method calls on interface-type variables - same as expected
- What functional interfaces are and how to use them - see decorator below

## Trying with classes
Can only inherit from 1
- What if we already inherit some logic?
- if `walk()` is on animal, what then when we make `class fish`?
	- Supers will have to be really small, and create long chains for more inheritance
## Interfaces
```java
public interface Walkable {
	void walk()
}

public class Duck implements Walkable {
	public void walk() { System.out.println("duck walking"); }
}
```

| Interface type            | Explanation                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Top-level interface       | What is described here                                                                                                 |
| Nested interface          | Interface declared in other interface. Classes can also be nested, used when generating empty objects of the interface | 
| Annotation-type interface |                                                                                                                        |

```java
interface AnInterface {
	// An abstract method
	int m1();
	// A static method
	static int m2() {
	// The method implementation goes here
	}
	// A default method
	default int m3() {
	// The method implementation goes here
	}
	// A private method
	private int m4() {
	// The method implementation goes here
	}
}
```

| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| nothing | public abstract                                                       |
| static  | public abstract - Impl defined in interface                           |
| default | Used when evolving interfaces, so existing impls can remain unchanged |
| private | For use in default or static methods                                                                      |

#### instanceof
In the case below, since some subclass of Course could later be made which implements Ownable, the compiletime check passes.
