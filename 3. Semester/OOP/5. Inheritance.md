#### Stuff

| Thing                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sub / super class                                        | Inheritans related. "Immediate" means 1 level                                                                                                |
| Object class                                             | Default super class. Added implicitly                                                                                                        |
| What is inheritet?                                       | Non-private stuff, not constructors                                                                                                          |
| Up / Downcasting                                         | Up: `{java}Employer emp = new Manager();` Down only works with casting `{java}Manager mgr = (Manager) emp;`                                  |
| Early binding (Binding from js `{js}this`)               | Done compile time. All fields, static methods, non-static final methods. Decisions about which class to call method from is made compiletime |
| Late binding                                             | non-static, non-final fields. `{java}Employer emp = new Manager(); emp.setName("name")` still uses `{java}Manager`'s method                  |
| Method hiding                                            | Overriding static method. "Hides" the original.                                                                                              |
| Field hiding                                             | instance fields with existing names hide the ancestor. Type doesn't matter                                                                   |
| Disable inheritance (Constructor)                        | private / package constructors can prevent inheritance, if constructor call is not allowed from sub                                          |
| Disable Inheritance                                      | `{java} public final class classname` cannot be inherited from                                                                               |
| `{java}public sealed class classname permits Sub1, Sub2` | Define who can inherit                                                                                                                                             |

```java
class subclass extends superclass {

}
```

**Rules for method overriding**

1. Only instance methods
2. Same name
3. Same number of parameters of the same type in the same order
   1. Generics may mess with this
4. Same return type. For objects, they only need be assignment-compatible
5. Same or more relaxed access level
6. A method may include a list of checked exceptions in its throws clause
   1. `{java}public void foo() throws CheckedException1, CheckedException2 { /\*_ Code here _/}
   2. Cannot add more, but may replace with descendents
