Analysing *what* the system should do

## 7.1 System Functions
Expresses *intent* of the system
>Function: A facility for making a model useful for actors.

A function is a requirement, realised through program operations
### Function Types
- Update
	- Activated by PD event. 
	- Changes model's state
- Signal
	- Activated by change to model state
	- Results in reaction in the context. Fx display message or direct intervention in problem domain (directly affecting the problem domain, after model was changed)
	- Used when model is in an undesirable state
- Read
	- Activated by actor need for info
	- Displays info
- Compute
	- Like read but with a computation involving info from actor or model.

Discussion about Read or Compute -> Doesn't matter, requirement was identified

### Analysing Functions
![](Pasted%20image%2020230920211120.png)
Easy to analyse, hard part is choosing which to include
Dont detail all functions, only complex.

> Principle: Identify all functions
> Principle: specify only complex functions

Example
- Update
	- Project groups are formed in PD, but entered into the model by a secretary in AD
### Events, User cases and Functions
- "Enter order"
	- Use case, something cleric goes to do
- "Create order"
	- Function which is part of use case
- "Ordered"
	- PD event
They all pose different requirements to the system
> Principle: Check consistency with use cases and the model
## 7.2 Find Functions
Consider sources for identifying functions
- Where the the system's function requirements come from
Consider the level of detail
- How detailed should function be described? General or specific?

#### Update functions
- Related to events
	- All events are sufficiently important to update some state in the model
- Questions
	- How is the event observed, and how is it registered? In which use cases does this happen?
	- How should the use cases be supported by update functions?
	- Which objects, attributes, and object structures are affected by the event, and what requirements does this impose on the update functions?

#### Read functions
- Related to classes
	- Defined classes, attributes, structures indicate something to display
- Information needed expressed in use case
- Questions
	- Given the work of the actors, what do the actors need to know about the state of the model? 
		- What read functions does this give rise to?
		- Which read functions do we need on each use case?
	- Given the model, which objects and structures will the actors need information about? 
		- What read functions does this give rise to?

#### Compute functions
- Info needs that cannot directly be read
- Related to use cases
	- Sequence not interrupted by user should be a single function
	- Consist of several parts -> consider more functions
		- Do not clutter
- Questions
	- Which computations (not necessarily based on the model) do the actors need to have carried out?
	- Does the computational basis come from the actors, the model, or both?
	- Which computations form complete wholes in the use cases?

#### Signal Functions
- Related to critical model state
	- State that should be valid, and reacted to if not. Bank account overdrawn.
- Questions
	- What are the critical states for the model?
	- What is the significance of these critical states? What are the consequences when they occur?
	- How does a signal function register that the model has entered a critical state?
	- What signals does each critical state give rise to? How reliable and strong do the signals have to be?

## 7.3 Specify Complex functions
Basic rule:
- describe functions briefly and informally in a list
- detailed specifications can be expressed as
	- $output = f(input)$
	- Simple sketched algorithm - structured language, not actual logic. Something akin to SQL, except non-functional![](Pasted%20image%2020230925093614.png)
	- functional partitioning into smaller functions![](Pasted%20image%2020230925093629.png)
#### Function list example

## 7.4 Evaluate systematically
3 ways to confirm. Evaluating for completeness, ensuring every function has been identified.
- Review with users
- Ensure possibilities are exhausted (questions in 7.2)
- Compare function list to system definition, model and use case

Differences between system definition general functions and these should be revised, and either should be changed to conform

Compare list to model. Model must include exactly the information needed for functions, no more, no less.

Make mocks and prototypes
