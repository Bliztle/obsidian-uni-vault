## 15.1 A Tailored Strategy
If designing for new technical platform, weight architectural design higher. If new type of application, do more in application domain analysis.
> Principle: Tailor the strategy

Since things change, the strategy should as well. It is a starting point.

> **Requirements**: A systemâ€™s externally observable behaviour.
> 
> **Conditions**: The technical, organisational, and human opportunities and limits involved in performing a task.
> 
> Strategy: A general approach for performing a task.

Basic principles for strategy and design:

> Principle: Identify the difficult requirements and conditions.
> 
> Principle: Maintain degrees of freedom.

## 15.2 Urgency of Strategy
Example of large danish company which invested deeply in new technology and PD + AD analysis, but didn't allow themselves degrees of freedom. Too occupied on tools and general analysis process. Didn't identify the hardest requirements in strategy either, and so focused too much on analysis instead of architecture design, which would be needed given completely new system patterns.

## 15.3 Characterise the Task
Qualify strategy knowledge with the following questions:
		Short answers, yes / no / maybe. Possible comment on no/maybe
- *Problem domain*: Are you familiar with the type of target system?
- *Application domain*: Are you familiar with the user organization?
- *Technical platform*: Are you familiar with the technology?
- *Development project*: How qualified are the developers? How good are the development conditions?
- *Special conditions*: Which special conditions apply to this task?

#### Source of inspiration for questions

## 15.4 Evaluate Difficulties
For evaluating difficulties, answers to the previous questions can be grouped in the following list.
- Positive answer -> Little difficulty
- Negative answer -> great difficulty
- Qualitative, holistic evaluation. Do ***NOT*** just count the answers.

## 15.5 Design the Strategy
Strategy prioritises first 3 activities. Component design naturally happens later.
- Focus on particularly problematic areas
- Critical decisions first, to maintain freedom for those
- Try to agree with client on requirements early on, and focus on simply fulfilling those.

Bullet points from book:
- Put highest emphasis on areas with great difficulty.
- Initiate activities in difficult areas early in the process.
- Make critical decisions first and less critical decisions later in the process.
- Design the strategy to ensure coordination of decisions.
- Include requirements management in the strategy.
- When necessary, attempt to alter development conditions to ensure a satisfactory system.

If impossible (or too hard) conditions arise, steer development in another direction.

## 15.6 Practical Application
chapter 22 has complete example

- First identify activities that can counteract difficulties
- Then relate specific activities to method's activities

## 15.7 Principles
- *Tailor the strategy*. To efficiently use development resources to manage difficulties in a software project, a strategy must be tailored to the situation.
- *Identify the difficult requirements and conditions*. The big project challenges and problems stem from disparity between requirements and realities. It is important that the development strategy identify critical areas that require special effort and attention.
- *Maintain degrees of freedom*. Unexpected problems will appear during analysis and design. The strategy should ensure that degrees of freedom are maintained for a possible redesign of system parts later in the process.
