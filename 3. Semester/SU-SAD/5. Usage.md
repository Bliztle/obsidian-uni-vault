# 6 Usage
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917122609.png)
Determine how the system should fit the application domain

## 6.1 Use Cases
Key concepts:
- Actor: An abstraction of users or other systems that interact with the target system
- Use case: A pattern for interaction between the system and actors in the application domain
Principle
- Determine the application domain with use cases

Can be initiated both by the target system or an actor
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917122935.png)
- Demands cooperation between users and developers
- Analytical as well as creative
- Descriptive and experimental
Must include users in most steps. Ground work can be done in advance, but everything needs testing
- Principle: Evaluate use cases in collaboration with users
- Principle: Asses social changes in the application domain
	- Does the system change social structures?

Results in summary table and deeper descriptions

Alternatively a use-case diagram can be used - Not recommended by OOA&D
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917123500.png)
Not classes and events
- This happens in a different domain
- Doesn't describe what (how) happens
	- Describes how actors interact with the system
- Events are things to remember, these are things to do

## 6.3 Find actors and Use Cases
Who will use the system? And how/why/to what?

### Identify Actors
Differentiate in roles and jobs performed. If group use for different purposes then they are likely different actors
- Analyse work tasks
	- Blitz method - Doing a lot of work is usually a waste here

	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020230925084433.png)
### Describe Actors
- Goal (Purpose)
	- Relation to the system
	- Why are they using it
- Characteristics
	- Important aspects of actors' use of the system
	- What is the width of the group?
- Example
	- Describe examples of this actor
### Describe Use Cases
Collect many possible ways of using the target system in a few well-chosen use cases
- Examine tasks of the application domain
- Sate chart diagram over use case or a use-case specification

Tasks the user performs which include using the system. It is not only the part directly involving the system and what the system does!

Use-case specification:
- Use Case
	- Describe semi-detailed case
	- Use use-case diagrams
- Objects
- Functions
Conveys overview but diagram is better at describing logic

**Group use-cases in diagram**

## 6.4 Explore patterns
Two fundamental use-case patterns to look for
### The procedural pattern
Ensures many rules are observed by fulfilling step by step
- Auth, then credit check, then withdrawal
![](Pasted%20image%2020230920135150.png)
### The Material Pattern
Not many rules are sequences, many options at any moment
- May have "modes", like "cursor positioned" or "text selected", which are exclusive and define different behaviour

General version

## 6.5 Evaluate Systematically
Thoroughly evaluate relevance of candidates, to includes lots of options in a few use cases
1. Carefully review descriptions for mistakes and inconsistencies
2. Test use-cases to see if they work in practice
3. Evaluate social changes in AD

Important issues:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917125146.png)

- Systematic Review
	- Each use case should be simple and constitute a coherent whole.
	- Descriptions of actors and use cases should provide understanding and overview.
	- Use cases should be described in enough detail to enable identification of functions and interface elements.
- Prototypes
	- Get close to real environment

### Stable vs transient properties
Model is stable
Functions may change 
Interface is incredibly changable - transient

## Challenges
Keep track of the differences in activitites between AD and PD
