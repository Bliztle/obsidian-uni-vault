## 5.1 Behavioural Pattern and Attributes
#event-trace
Behaviour is defined by an event trace
> Event trace: *A sequence of events involving a specific object.*
> 
> Customer example:
> account opened – amount deposited – amount withdrawn – amount deposited –account closed

While describing objects, for practical purposes classes are instead described using *behavioural patterns*
> Behavioural pattern: *A description of possible event traces for all objects in a class.*

## 5.2 Notation for Behavioural Patterns

| Structure | Description                               | Symbol | Graphic                                  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sequence  | Events in a set occur one by one          | +      | ![](Pasted%20image%2020230917111330.png) | 
| Selection | Exactly one out of a set of events occurs | \|     | ![](Pasted%20image%2020230917111344.png) |
| Iteration | An event occurs zero or more times        | \*     | ![](Pasted%20image%2020230917111401.png) |

Uses a type of regex
> account opened + (amount deposited | amount withdrawn)* + account closed

Slightly expanded version where closed account can re-open:

## 5.3 Describe Behavioural Patterns
Identifying and ordering events from event table
- Which events cause the creation of a problem-domain object? These events are grouped as selections that can cause the birth of an object.
- Which events cause the disappearance of a problem-domain object? These events are grouped as selections that can cause the death of an object.

These are not equivalent to the object being created / deleted in the system itself. A closed bank account refers to a "dead" customer (the PD object), but banks still need to read it.

### Final state
- Object can no longer perform or suffer events
- State can still be read by a function
	- Bank account can still be read, even if no money can be deposited

**In design**
- Decide how long to keep object - GDPR?

### Form
- Structured
	- Sequence of events with some selection / iteration involved
- Unstructured
	- Most events can happen at all times. People in PD are often modelled this way, as they usually have many options.
- Ask the questions
	- Is the overall form structured or unstructured?
	- Which events occur together in a sequence?
	- Are there any alternative events?
	- Can a given event occur more than once?
### Sufficient but simple
Don't get all too specific, allowing later changes to the diagram without great troubles

Flexible:

### Maintain overview
Update event table to describe types of events
- + : zero or one times
- \* : zero or many times

## 5.4 Explore Patterns
3 basic patterns used
### The Stepwise Relation Pattern
Subscribing to multiple aggregated classes
Getting assigned to ... then ...
- Semester - Class - Group in class

### The Stepwise Role Pattern
Horizontal - Behaviour of the whole changes as parts become active

### The Composite Pattern
Used when creation / destruction hierarchy is unknown at model-development time.
- May be the case that behaviour depends on behaviour further down, or recursion occurs
Example of part which may be simple and ready or a composite of other parts, possibly needing to be assembled:

## 5.5 Consider Structures
Behaviour should be consistent with structures. Revisit.
- Aggregation and Association
	- If two or more objects have common events, consider adding an aggregation or association structure between them.
	- If two classes are related by an aggregation or association structure, at least one common event should be considered.
- Generalization
	- If the same event is tied to two classes, consider whether one class is a generalization of the other.
		- Events of sub must themselves be sub-events if described in super
	- If two classes have many events with the same name, consider whether they are different specializations of a third class.

## 5.6 Consider Classes
Bank should have both Customer and Account classes instead of only customer, since customers can open or close multiple accounts, and the sequence `close -> close` makes no sense on its own
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917115016.png)
Relations in diagrams are shown here as reacting to events with the same name

Look for places where an extra class simplifies state chart
