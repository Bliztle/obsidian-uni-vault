Ideas behind OOD&A

## 1.1 Objects and Classes
|                 |                                                                                                 |     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Object          | An entity with identity, state, and behaviour                                                   | Identity: `myChair`. State is current. behaviour is what has happened to it.    |
| Class           | A description of a collection of objects sharing infrastructure                                 |     |

### Analysis and design objects
- Analysis
	- Phenomena outside the system
	- Identiy indentifies the object
	- State is properties and relations
	- Behvaior is events object has performed or suffered

|                 |                                                                                                 |     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Analysis object | Expressed by events it performs or experiences<br>Outside the system, typically independent     |     |
| Design Object   | Expressed by operations it can carry out or make available<br>Within the system, in our control |     |

### Advantages of Object-Orientation
Universal, easier correlation between layers of abstraction

## 1.2 Model the context
*The systems models something (**the problem domain**) and it is operated by some entities (**The application domain**)*

|                    |                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem domain     | That part of a context that is administrated, monitored, or controlled by a system |
| Application domain | The organization that administrates, monitors, or control a problem domain         | 

Model models the state of PD

AD also includes the system itself (2nd lecture, also written in street food example)

- PD
	- Greenhouse and temperature - This is what we eventually want to control
- AD
	- The gardener. He is doing things
- Other
	- Sprinkler, window motor, heater and sensor are none of these, as they don't pertain to the problem itself, but rather the solution.
## 1.3 Emphasize the Architecture
|        |                                                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System | A collection of components that implement the modeling requirements, functions, and interfaces |

Basic model has 3 components build on top of each other

| Component | Details                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Model     | Dynamic model of the problem domain - System state                             |
| Functions | Exposed methods to alter the state                                             |
| Interface | What the user and/or other systems directly interact with to perform functions |

## 1.4 Reuse patterns
If something works use it again. Doesn't go into implementation details here like inheritance

## 1.5 Tailor the Method
OOA&D is a set of guidelines and should be tailored to the situation

### Four pespectives
Understood in listed order

| Perspective   | Details                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information   | The system must offer a useful model of the problem domain                                                |
| User          | The system must be integrated in the application domain. Must understand who acts with the system and how |
| Architectural | The system must run on a specific technical platform. How and where should components be split up?        |
| As a whole    | The system should be a well-functioning unit of cooperating parts                                         |

### Four Main Activities
![](Pasted%20image%2020230906134810.png)

Iterative. Starting order depends on importance and certainty, IE. how much we know about each perspective.

## 1.6 Results
Everything results in documentation. Should be clear and concise.

## 1.8 Principles (Summay)
OOA&D's 4 principles

| Principle                                   | Details                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model the context                           | Useful systems fit their contexts. Model both application- and model domain |
| Emphasize architecture                      | Flexible architecture is easier to follow and expand later                  |
| Reuse patterns                              | Steal, steal, steal                                                         |
| Tailor the method to suit specific projects | Entire process should be altered to fit situation                                                                            |

# 2 System Choice

## 2.1 System Definition
|                   |                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System definition | A concise description of a computerized system expressed in natural language | 
Expressed fundamental properties. System in context, information contained, functions provided, where it is used and which development conditions apply

### FACTOR

| Letter | Meaning            |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| F      | Functionality      |
| A      | Application domain |
| C      | Conditions         |
| T      | Technology         |
| O      | Objects            |
| R      | Responsibility     | 

see [2.7 The FACTOR criterion](#2.7%20The%20FACTOR%20criterion)
## 2.2 Choosing the system
Iterate through 3 subactivities

| Subactivity | Details                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Situation   | Which challenges are we facing              |
| Ideas       | create and evaluate ideas for system design |
| Systems     | Formulate and choose definition             |

## 2.3 Describe the situation
**Principle**: Appreciate the situation
### Rich pictures
Massive pictures displaying an overview of the situation, be that a change or the problem or something else entirely
- Relevant structures of user's work
- Concrete experience with user's work
#### Drawing rich pictures
1. People are usually a place to start
2. Draw objects related to situation
3. Problem owner - The entity which identifies the problem. Can be a part of this
4. Come up with good symbols for all drawings
#### Processes
Arrows between entities describing change / unstable relationship / under development
#### Structures
Lines or encapsulations describing stable or difficult to change relations
#### Problems
Crossed swords describing conflicts or differences. Add a few words
#### Practical advice
![](Pasted%20image%2020230904213323.png)

## 2.4 Create Ideas
**Principle**: Cultivate new ideas

Generate and evaluate in coop with users using
- Exemplars
- methaphors
- experiments
### Exemplars
Study similar existing solutions
- Which ideas lay the groundwork for the system?
- Do the ideas seem useful? Why?
- Will the ideas work in your context? Why?
- Can the ideas be adapted to your system? How?
### Metaphors
Find similarly representing situations
Library -> Warehouse management -> Store -> School
1. Create list of related aspects
2. Transfer to target system
rest parameters3. Determine which aspects are useful
### Experiments
Prototyping, either popping / acting or developing very small programs illustrating the solution

## 2.5 Experiments with prototypes
rough sketches, no error handling, limited input, bad UI
contains maybe 1 or 2 of model, functions, interface

2 types of experiments

| Type        | Details                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exploratory | Proto to develop new design ideas                       |
| Evaluating  | 2-3 prototypes for comparison, choosing specific design | 

Requires 
1. Planning
2. Development
3. Preparation
4. Test
5. Summarising

### Planning
Ask clear question to answer

For model, functions, interface, ask:
- What is the focus of the experiment?
- What has been excluded?
- Which prerequisites must be fulfilled?

|            | Focus | Limitations | Prerequisites |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Interfaces |       |             |               |
| Functions  |       |             |               |
| Model           |       |             |               |
### Development
Move fast, need those results
### Preparation
Exploratory should involve real users

Make decisions about
- Cooperation
- Realisim
- Selection

What are the expectations to the user and how will results be collected?
### Test
Do it. Most tests can only be done once, so be careful. 

### Summarise
Look at the results

## 2.6 Define systems
**Principle**: Define alternative systems
Choose the actual system to develop
### Systems are holistic views
Designers, programmers and administrators sees different things, system definitions combine them all.
- Focus on emergent system-focused properties, not individual components
	- User friendliness is a general aspect only determined here

Work with multiple systems before choosing
### Sample definitions
#example
![](Pasted%20image%2020230904220252.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020230904220309.png)
### Practical advice
- Use general terms and focus emergent properties
- Focus on ideas rather than describing the situation
- Brief and precise
- Experiment with several definitions
- Think outside the box
- Discover additional properties through selection process

| O      | Objects            | Main objects in problem domain                                                                                    |
| R      | Responsibilities   | Responsibilities to context. What is the system responsible for, excluding anything where the user  or another system is responsible | 

## 2.8 Evaluation and choice
Systems developer facilitates options but decision is done in colab with all involved parties
