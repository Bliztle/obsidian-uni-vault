| System       | A collection of components that implements modeling requirements, functions, and interfaces. |
| Architecture | A general structure that is later developed further                                          | 

Objects are viewed differently in design than analysis

# 9 Criteria
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927144954.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927145501.png)
## 9.1 Good Design
Quality is the absence of flaws, evaluated to which extent the design meets the requirements.
> ***Principle**: A good design has no major weaknesses.*

The goal is a design describing the system in a way which eliminates uncertainties. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927145401.png)
## 9.2 Consider General Criteria
3 important design criteria:
> ***Principle**: A good design is usable, flexible, and comprehensible

| Criteria       | Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usable         | Quality depends on how it works in context                                   |
| Flexibility    | Architecture accommodates future changes to org or technical conditions      |
| Comprehensible | Given growing complexity, models and descriptions must be easy to understand | 

- Usability
	- Doesn't care about inner workings
	- Use affordances (DEB) without bottlenecks
- Flexibility
	- Designs are made with insufficient knowledge
		- Allow changes when more is known
	- Modular designs
- Comprehensibility
	- Use and reuse patterns and abstractions
	- Grouping responsibilities
	- Modular designs also work here

## 9.3 Analyse Specific Conditions
Conditions for decomposing systems into smaller parts
- Conditions should b virtually invariable terms
	- Not unconscious expressions of a tradition
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927151020.png)
- Technical opportunities
	- Use whatever is offered
	- Only a few areas should use bleeding-edge tech
		- It adds uncertainty and takes time to get acquainted
		- Increased risk of failure
- Human
	- What are the designers personal weaknesses?
	- Are they biased?

## 9.4 Prioritise
Rank how important aspects are to prioritise time
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927151411.png)
## 9.5 Principles
>In this chapter, we discussed how you can specify design criteria in a system development project. The following principles summarize our main points.
>
>A *good design has no major weaknesses*. A single flaw can be enough to invalidate a design. A good design thus strives to achieve good properties and, at the same time, avoid badones.
>
>A good design balances several criteria. A good design must meet several criteria. Because these criteria can be conflicting, prioritizing all criteria is essential.
>
>A good design is usable, flexible, and comprehensible. The system’s usability is determined by tensions between the system’s technical qualities and its applicability to the users’ work.
>Flexibility and comprehensibility help ease design and implementation work.

# 10 Components
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927151601.png)
*structural system view that separates system concerns*
A good component architecture makes a system easier to understand

*Which units / parts make up the system?*

#### Example
![](Pasted%20image%2020231002092004.png)

## 10.1 System Components
> ***Component architecture**: A system structure composed of interconnected components.*

>***Component**: A collection of program parts that constitutes a whole and has well-defined responsibilities.*

![](Pasted%20image%2020230927151818.png)
In OOP most components are classes. One component is usually made out of multiple.
- Definition of component is intentionally broad

Separate components should address separate concerns
> ***Principle**: Reduce complexity by separating concerns.*

experimental and iterative process to bridge the gap between requirements and technical options. If we know "model" component is stable, it is easier to build multiple "User Interface"-like components
> ***Principle**: Reflect stable context structures.*

DO not reinvent the wheel, and make components generic and flexible
> ***Principle**: Reuse existing components.*

## 10.2 Explore Architectural Patterns
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927190902.png)
### The Layered Architecture Pattern
Layered components where each component exposes functions to the one above it
- Ex. OSI **network layers**
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927193250.png)
Layers can be composed of pseudo-independent parts
![](Pasted%20image%2020231002092803.png)
If parts on the same layer interact a lot, that indicates a design error.
#### Variation of the layered architecture pattern
4 variations

|                |              |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Closed-Strict  | Open-Strict  |
| Closed-Relaxed | Open-Relaxed | 

From the terms

| Term    | Description                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Closed  | Layers can only access adjacent layers |
| Open    | Any layer distance                     |
| Strict  | Only layers below                      |
| Relaxed | Both directions                        | 

Useful for altering systems, by knowing where a method is used.
- Consequences are easy to determine
### The Generic Architecture Pattern
Extension of layered architecture
![](Pasted%20image%2020231002093730.png)
In the example, a technical platform is added, connecting the system to a User Interface System (UIS), DataBase System (DBS) and Network System (NS) as the final place layers communicate with
- UIS for displaying the user interface part of the interface component
- NS for attaching the network interface to a network so it can be called
- DBS for saving the model statically
### The Client-Server Architecture Pattern
Many clients independently of each other connecting to a central server
![](Pasted%20image%2020231002094139.png)
Similar way of thinking to the layered architecture, where the server layer exposes functions to the client layer
- Only different in the 1..\* relationship
#### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
![](Pasted%20image%2020231002094320.png)
Controller updates model from interactions, and updates view when model changes
## 10.3 Define Subsystems
Large systems are divided into smaller systems communicating with each other
![](Pasted%20image%2020231002094855.png)
This general architecture is `Closed-Strict`, and so the system interface must `observe` activity in the function layer, to know when to defer tasks from user actions.

A `Closed-Relaxed` approach allows the function layer to send the message to other subsystems, decreasing complexity from the observer pattern, as the function layer handles deferring
- Function component then gets multiple responsibilities
	- Reduces definition, cohesiveness and comprehensibility

## 10.4 Identify Components
1. Start by assuming layered architecture
2. Extend with decompositions by looking at model/functions/interface together
3. Look at encapsulating technical platform - Is it possible with existing components?

Summarised design concerns:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927202654.png)

Model
- Make sure it updates when PD does
- Careful with decomposition
	- Good for complex PD
	- Analysis clusters are likely tightly coupled, and should stay as one
	- Unrelated objects can be separated in the model
	- How fast must the model update?
- Admin systems often rely HEAVILY on this

Function
- Can be substituted with multiple layers
- Incohesive or complex functions could be decomposed
- Control / Monitoring systems are heavily relying on this layer
- Cryptography would often be its own layer here, independent of operations

Interface
- Decompose into User and System interfaces if possible
	- CLI is the one possible exception (ish)
		- CLI for users is likely fine for systems / scripting
- Add parts when usage is incohesive
- One component per interface type / possible for large difference within type (standalone phone ui?)

#### Using Existing Components
To what extent should you reuse components? (from other systems / earlier version)
- The system will likely interface with legacy systems.
- Certain standard components must be used.
- External suppliers can supply advanced class libraries.

This includes standard libraries (STD) or bought packages (DevExtreme)

#### Extending the Technical Platform
