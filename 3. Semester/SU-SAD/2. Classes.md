*What information should the system deal with?*

![](Pasted%20image%2020230909151204.png)
- Select objects, classes and events that will be the elements
- Build model focusing on structural relations between elements
- Finally focus on the objects' dynamic properties (behaviour)

## 3. Classes
#classes
![](Pasted%20image%2020230909151430.png)
- *Abstract* problem-domain phenomena by seeing them as objects and events
- *Classify* objects and events
- Select which classes and events the system will maintain information on
Produce event table

> Example exist. See chapter 20

### 3.1 Classification of Objects and Events
***Principle:** Classify objects in the problem domain*
Classify the ideal, not *as is*

- Object
	- Thing / Org in the system


| Term   | Details                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Object | Entity: What it is apart from other classed objects <br> Identity: What identifies the individual object from other of same class<br> State: Static and dynmaic properties<br>Behaviour: Sequence of events it performs or experiences                                  |
| Event  | An instantaneous incident involving one or more objects<br>Instantanious: Events are defined as taking to time, for simplicities sake. They happen at a single moment<br>Atmoic: Cannot be broken down. No sub-events. |
|        |                                                         |

### 3.3 Find events
#events
Not verbs performed by users, they would be application domain

Examples of events:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230909153149.png)
Choose names that
- are simple and readable,
- originate in the problem domain, and
- indicate a single event.

We only want events we need to keep track of. It is not everything we need to react to.
### 3.4 Evaluate Systematically
Include event / class if and only if the system functions use information about it
- Is the class or event within the system definition?
- Is the class or event relevant for the problem-domain model?
	- Should not reflect aspects of application domain or the system
	- Consider if the user itself is actually relevant to problem domain. Often not if access-control is not relevant
- Do we want the system to support administration, monitoring, or control of this object or event?
Should agree with system definition

Classes have events, events do not. So if something can be both, look at if state changes with time.

- Class criteria
	- Can you identify objects from the class?
	- Does the class contain unique information?
	- Does the class encompass multiple objects?
		- Usually, but doesn't have to
	- Does the class have a suitable and manageable number of events?
- Event criteria
	- Is the event instantaneous?
	- Is the event atomic?
	- Can the event be identified when it happens?
		- We have to be able to actually register the event happening. May have to rely on proxy events, with the desired event not being registered.
	- Examples
		- Search function in system is not an event unless we keep track of searches done. Otherwise it is simply a function.
