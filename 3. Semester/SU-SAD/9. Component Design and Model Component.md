Exposes model data to functions and eventually user
Central concept is structure! Should reflect conceptual relations.
Designing may lead to revisionment of PD analysis

## 12.1 Designing the Model Component
> ***Model component**: A part of a system that implements the problem-domain model.*

Should be tied to the Structure activity, while closely following state-chart diagrams

>***Attribute**: A descriptive property of a class or an event.*

As events are logged in some way, the OOP representation of events is based on the principle:
> ***Principle**: Represent events as classes, structures, and attributes.*

As this can be modelled in many ways:
> ***Principle**: Choose the simplest representation of events.*

Redesign event table and structures as you go, so simplify
## 12.2 Represent Private Events
Events that only involve a single object
- Changing customer address
	- It may be used later elsewhere, but event only changes this

#### Guidelines
- Happens once
	- Attribute
- Multiple times, recorded
	- Class / list of classes

## 12.3 Represent Common Events
Represent event in relation to one of the objects, possibly adding structural connections to others

#### Choosing the Simplest Representation
Look at the event table for where it can simply be included

#### Choosing Between Alternatives
If the common event is only involved in iterations between all classes
- Try multiple options
- Choose simplest
##### Example from bank
Adding `Deposit` and `Withdrawn`. Option A is a lot simpler

## 12.4 Restructure Classes
After adding a lot in previous step, restructure with known structuress

#### Generalisation
Example from above restructured:

#### Association
Some associations may have become superfluous

Example with `Filling` being added as class, from event, where the association between `Gas Station` and `Customer` is removed

#### Embedded Iterations
Structures may have to be changed to more clearly communicate order of iterations.

Consider the following:

This design model does not show Discharge comes after a specific Hospitalisation, and that treatment is coupled to a specific hospitalisation.

It is instead changed like so:

## 12.5 Principles
> ***Represent events as classes, structures, and attributes.** The class diagram from the analysis activity is revised by systematically representing the objectsâ€™ events in new classes, structures, and attributes.*

> ***Choose the simplest representation of events.** If a common event is only involved in iterations, you might have to outline and compare concrete design alternatives.*
