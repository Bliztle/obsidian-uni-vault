## 14.1 Coupling and Cohesion
The goal is cohesive classes with loosely coupled components -> Less dependent on each other
>***Principle**: Highly cohesive classes and loosely coupled components.*

**Nearly decomposable systems**
The ideal
- So loose coupling that if it loosened the coupling would fall apart
- Applies at all levels
	- System
	- Components
	- Classes

#### Coupling
*Negative property*
Coupling is when a change in one class necessitates a change in another
>***Coupling**: A measure of how closely two classes or components are connected.*

Takes 4 forms, ranging from low to full coupling

| Form                  | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Outside coupling*    | A class / component refers directly to another class / component            |
| *Inside coupling*     | An operation refers directly to other, private properties in the same class |
| *Coupling from below* | A Specialised class refers directly to private properties in the same class |
| *Sideways coupling*   | A class refers directly to private properties in another class              | 

#### Cohesion
Cohesion is when a class / component constitutes a whole with essential relations between its parts
>***Cohesion**: A measure of how well a class or component is tied together*

Attempting to split up cohesive classes leads to high coupling

Cohesive classes
- Operations constitute a functional whole.
- Attributes and object structures describe objects with well-defined states.
- Operations use each other.

Cohesive components
- Component classes are conceptually related.
- Structural relations among classes are primarily generalisations and aggregations.
- Key operations can be carried out ***within*** the component.

#### Connecting Components
Design connections among dependent components to maintain cohesiveness, but ensure connection is loosely coupled.

## 14.2 Connect Classes
*Relationships == Dependencies*

3 connections
- Aggregating another component’s classes.
- Specialising another component’s public class.
- Calling public operations in another component’s objects.

#### Class aggregation
`Account Management` function class has 1..\* `Account` model class
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928163229.png)
Opening and closing accounts would then be in `Account Management`
- Generally low coupling - Outside coupling

#### Class Specialisation
Often done by inheriting from technical platform
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928163455.png)
Here the 2 UI windows inherit from `Window`
- Low coupling if restrained to public operations
- Medium if private operations / super attributes are used

#### Operation Call
Often in internal code, simply creating and calling other objects
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928163800.png)
Complex call connections should use the strategy pattern

## 14.3 Explore patterns
One particularly relevant pattern

#### Observer Pattern
*Event listeners*
Dependent objects are notified when state changes. Notifying object knows nothing about dependants.

General version using specialisation

Sequence diagram of the operation. Not optimal, update doesn't send the updated value, but it's the basic idea.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928164149.png)
Can be used for "passive" signals. Not using this pattern, using aktive signals, would tightly couple the components. Like this, Subject doesn't care what the observing signal class does.

Pattern in use:

## 14.4 Evaluate Connections
Stress low coupling!
Avoid the risks in the table below:

## 14.5 Principles
>***Highly cohesive classes and loosely coupled components.** You must make trade-offs to achieve classes and components that are both cohesive and have low coupling between them. The observer pattern is an example of how to implement this principle.*
