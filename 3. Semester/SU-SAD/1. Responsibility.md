*You should design ubicom (Ubiquitous computing) systems on the assumption that the set of participating users, hardware, and software is highly dynamic and unpredictable. Clear invariants that govern the entire system's execution should exist*

For ubicomp:
- Physical integration implies "The resources available to you are sometimes highly constrained"
- Spontaneous integration means "The resources available to you are highly dynamic but you must work anywhere, with minimal or no intervention"
## The semantic Rubicon
#responsibility #factor
Designers must early deside what the system should **NOT** do, IE. what the user will do instead

*System designers must decide the humanâ€™s role to resolve tension between interoperability and ambiguity.*
