Structure describes something static over time

*Cursives* are abstract classes. They don't directly have any relations.
### 4.1 Object-Oriented Structures

|                        |                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggregation structures | Relation between an object and its component objects |
| Association structures | Other meaningful object relations                    | 

### 4.2 Structures between classes
Two types
- Generalisation structures
	- Inheritance
- Cluster structures
	- Collection of several classes in single concept

### 4.3 Structures between objects

#### Aggregation Structure
Romb to annotate object being a whole, partly consisting of other objects
*"Has a" or "Is part of"*

#### Association Structure
Looser relation. A person doesn't consist partly of a car, but they are still related

### 4.4 Find Candidates for Structures
- Identify Generalisations
	- Are candidates similar?
	- Attempt each pair
	- Can we create general classes?
- Identify Aggregations
	- 3 typical structures
		- *Whole-part* - Whole is sum of parts. Changing part dramatically changes whole
		- *Container-content* - Whole is container for parts
		- *Union-members*
- Identify Associations
- Identify Clusters

### 4.5 Explore Patterns

| Pattern         | Diagram                                                                                                                                         |

### 4.6 Evaluate Systematically
- Structures must be used correctly
	- Don't confuse Aggregation and association
- Structures must be conceptually true
	- Names, concepts and relations reflect users' understanding. 
		- High ideal
		- Problem domain should express future user's understanding
- Structures must be simple
	- Don't use unnecessary generalisations or aggregations
![](Pasted%20image%2020230913084709.png)
An object being replaced by a different object which is conceptually identified as the same thing, counts as an object changing classes. 
- A time period in previous example is identified by the time, so replacing free with work violates this
- Can still be necessary, for example with Apprentice or
