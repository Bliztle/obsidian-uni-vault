Moved on to design, from ideas to actually implementing the system

Taking all abstract concepts and turning them into concrete realisations. 
- Cyclic - Implementing may teach you something so you should adjust design concepts again
## Physical design
everything in the system people come into contact with
> Physical design is concerned with how <u>things are doing to work</u> and with <u>detailing the look and feel of the product</u>. Physical design is about <u>structuring interactions into logical sequences</u> and about <u>clarifying and presenting</u> the allocation of <u>functions and knowledge between people, channels and devices</u>

- Operational design
	- How everything works and content is structured and stored
- Representation design
	- Fixing colours, shapes, sizes and info layout
	- Style / aesthetics
- Interaction design
	- allocation of functions to humans or to technology (responsibility) with structuring and sequencing of the interactions

#### UI Classifications
- Command promt (cli)
	- Enter text, hit enter, get response
	- Powerful, but requires much user knowledge, as there isn't much feedback
- GUI
	- Full on graphics, representing files as physical objects
		- Directories are shown as old binders
	- Easier to use as options are shown
		- Limited by having to show all options
	- Can show previews (logos)
	- Interactions:
		- Direct manipulation
			- Selects object and manipulates it in real time, moving a physical folder, and interacting with simple button clicks
			- "Continous representation of the object of interest"
			- Rapid incremental reversible decisions
		- WIMP
			- Windows
				- Things live in windows
			- Icons
				- Small familiar pictures, strong meaning
				- Checklist for good icons:![](Pasted%20image%2020230917153245.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020230917153528.png)
			- Menus
				- Fx Cascading
					- Choosing menu shows other menu
				- Show a lot of options without taking up space when not open
				- Fx Radial menu
					- Like context but circular, mouse in direction chooses
					- Warframe / OW gear wheel
			- Pointers
				- Cursors changing by status

### Widgets
Various "input devices" (not benyon term)
- Radio buttons
	- Mutually exclusive
- Drop down
	- Radio different layout
- Check boxes
	- Inclusive radio
All this kind of stuff are widgets
Some have slight validation like date pickers or formatting for URL or password fields

Toolbars are also widgets. Think top menu in IE excel. Many commands in a small amount of space
- Usually are mirrored in shortcuts or other things, think copy with right click vs ctrl + c

## Heuristics
See how proposed design meassures up against a list of principles
- Nielsen's revised
	- 7 revsed heuristics, better than his original list
		1. Visibility of system status
			- Status bars / loading
		2. Match between system and real world
			- Credit card input actually looks like a credit card
		3. User control and Freedom
			- Fx undo actions - Undeleting an email, by showing toast with undo action option
		4. Consistency and standards
			- Follow standards if they exist, IE. using google's Material Theme user is familiar with
		5. Error prevention
			- Directly help the user avoid errors
			- Password fields showing requirements and updating with whether req is satisfied
		6. Recognition rather than recall
			- Fx show user what they bought earlier (bilka) to allow quick re-buy
		7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
			- Both menu and shortcuts
			- If we are developing to developers, they like keyboard stuff and macros
			- Actions shouldn't be locked behind an unecessary amount of interactions
- Petrie and Power
	- 4 Areas
		- Physical Representation
			1. Make text and interactive elements large and clear enough
			2. Make page layout clear
			3. Avoid shot time-outs and display times
			4. Make key content and elements and changes to them salient
				- Visible and clearly shown
		- Content
			5. Relevant and appropriate content
			6. Provide sufficient but not excessive content
			7. Provide clear terms, abbreviations, **avoid jargon**
		- Information Architecture
			8. Provide clear, well-organised information structures
		- Interactivity
			9. How and why?
			10. Clear labels and instructions
			11. Avoid duplication and excessive efforts by user
			12. Make input formats clear and easy
			13. Provide feedback on user actions and system progress
			14. Make the sequence of interaction logical
			15. Provide a logical and complete set of options
			16. Follow conventions for interaction
			17. Provide the interactive functionality users will need and expect
			18. Indicate if links go to an external site or to another webpage
				- Some links have small icon next to them for this
			19. Interactive and non-interactive elements should be clearly distinguished
			20. Group interactive elements clearly and logically
			21. Provide informative error messages and error recovery
