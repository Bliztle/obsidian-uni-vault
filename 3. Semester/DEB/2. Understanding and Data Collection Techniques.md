*What is it that should be build?*

Turning stories into conceptual scenarios
## Requirements analysis
- What people do
- What people want to do
- How people do what they do

Understanding includes requirement-...
- Gathering
	- Existing reqs, IE laws or user request
- Generation
- Elicitation
	- More than what user initially says
	- Dig deeper by asking questions
- Engineering
	- Taking active role in building requirements so they satisfy org or stakeholders
Trying to build an understanding of the situation

### Functional vs non-functional requirements
- Functional requirements
	- What the system must do
- Non-functional requirements
	- Qualities that a system must have
	- More "fluffy" or qualitative
		- Should often require extra work to make explicit and exact
	- Requirement categories examples under "Non-functional" from lecture
		- Usability requirements
		- Image / Branding requirements
		- Maintainability requirements
		- Performance requirements
			- Availability requirements. "Should be externally available on the web for users between 08:00 and 18:00 on workdays"
		- Accessibility requirements

### Documenting requirements
Agree on requirements in writing to avoid future disagreements
- Must be testable, to confirm that agreed-upon requirements are fulfilled.
- Avoiding lawsuits with documentation

Different ways of specifying
#### Requirements table
![](Pasted%20image%2020230909173037.png)
Could be worked with MoSCoW as

| MoSCoW term   | Priority | Example definition, can be modified                 |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Must have     | 1        | Supported by standard version                       |
| Should have   | 2.x      | Important addition. Supported from subversion x     |
| Could have    | 3.x      | Nice-to-have additions, supported from subversion x |
| Will not have | 4.y      | Not at this time. Will be in later version y        |

## Methods for gaining understanding (Data collection methods)

**! You are not designing for you**
**! Gather stories from stakeholders**

### Interviews and Contextual Inquiry
- Interviews
	- Structured
		- Only pre-planned questions
		- All participants get same questions
		- Requires better pre-understanding
	- Semi-structured
		- Loose understanding of desired questions, but allow conversation to move with area of interest
	- Unstructured
		- General understanding of goal, but no larger structure
		- Good initially for general concerns
- Contextual Inquiry
	- Context (actual work)
		- Understanding actual work
		- Where do they work, who do they come into contact with. "Look over the shoulder" of the user
	- Partnership (division of expertise)
		- You have skills in interviews and design, stakeholder / customer know their environment and do their job with better subject matter understanding than you
	- Interpretation (abstraction)
		- Look for tendencires and write abstracted version. Generalise experiences, based on users understanding
	- Focus (too detailed vs too broad)
		- Too broad
			- Looking at all aspects at once. Can be hard to plan design like this. Break it down.
		- Too detailed
			- Individual movements of mouse or individual elements. 
				- Only do this when relevant. Often not at all.

#### Consider activities in context
PACT activity questions
- What is the purpose of what the users do?
- What are the factors affecting their circumstances
	- Physical
	- Organisational
	- Social

### Questionnaires (Quantifiable data)
Be prepared. Users do not want to fill out multiple forms
- Run pilot test on lower amount of users to edit
- Try to use validated questionares
	- Existing standards which are documented how to understand.
	- Tested before so questions are known to be phrased correctly for best understanding
	- Example:
		  ![](Pasted%20image%2020230909175201.png)
	  - Find on google scholar or similar

### Cultural Probes
![](Pasted%20image%2020230909175352.png)
Hand out activites (Suitcase) to user, where user then engages with materials

- List of probes allows user to curate which way to gather information is easiest

### Field Observations
![](Pasted%20image%2020230909175621.png)
Allows observing users engaging with activities / techniques they forget to report. Things they do out of habbit which are still important.
- Users may report "official use" and not actual use
- Be mostly fly on the wall, so user performs as they normally would

### 7.6 Card sortings
> Finding something on a website is like looking for scissors in someone else's kitchen. You know they are there, just not where

Print things out on cards and let users rearrange them to their needs, to better understand intuitive approches to UI design

### 7.9 Artefact collection (Desk work)
While user performs activity, look for remedies they use to support them
