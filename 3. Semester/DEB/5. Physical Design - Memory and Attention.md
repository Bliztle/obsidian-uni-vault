human capacities and limitations 
- He greatly recommends actually reading this time

Looking at how design can meet humans' capacities and limitations, so tied to understanding.

## Memory
Memory is primarily affected by:
- Awareness
- Motivations
- Affect
- Attention

#### Multi-store memory
![](Pasted%20image%2020230917160335.png)
Inputs are "buffered" in sensory stores, allowing recall of a couple of seconds of audio even if we werent listening
- Someone saying something can be recalled even if we were busy. Fx saying "what" but remembering instantly.

- Visual-spatial sketchpad
	- Minds eye - Envision things
- Articulatory loop
	- Repeating / recalling sound to remember

Distinctive things are easier to remember

> **Working memory may only allow remembering 4+-1 items**

Easier to remember with chunking
- 15132770326 is a sequence, 11 independent numbers
- 1 (513) 277-0326 is a phone, and easier to remember
	- Danish numbers are usually recalled as 4 2-digit numbers

### Recall and recognition
Fonts in text programs show sample, so we only have to recognise. Recalling from name would be impossible

Users are limited
- Word asks if you want to save before closing, in case you forgot

### Attention
What we focus on
> Concentration of mental effort on sensory or mental events (Solso 1995)

#### Complexity of attention
The stroop effect
- Hard to read colors when text red is color green

Types of attention
- Selective attention
	- Focus on one detail
	- Video plays other video, exercise is to count how many times the players in white pass the ball
		- 15 times, but selective attention can cause you to not see the gorilla
- Divided attention
	- Example from elder scrolls, think massive WoW UI
	- Hard to notice specific things, when everything is drawing attention -> Nothing gets attention

Stress / Stimuli affect attention
There is an optimal level of arousal. For simpler tasks, arousal gives returns for longer. Complex tasks should not have much arousal.

#### Cocktail party effect


#### Models
Mental workload can give a description of how hard something is to do

Visual search - Search patterns cannot be predicted without more info
Pattern for finding F below is unpredictable
Designers can design page to help users search

Alerts and errors should be used appropriatly. Think if it should demand attention/action or distract from task.
