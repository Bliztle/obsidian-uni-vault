Perception
- How we sensee / come to know the environment
	- Primarily based on vision, in 2D or 3D planes

## Visual perception
Detecting
- Color
- Shapes
- Edges

### Theories of visual perception
![](Pasted%20image%2020230923115834.png)
Depth perception
- Critical in 3D
- Used in 2D
	- Shadows
- Cues for understanding / determining depth
	- Primary (process of creating single image with depth)
		- Retinal disparity (two separate images)
		- Stereopsis (Image combination process)
		- Accomodation (Muscular process to create image focus)
		- Convergence (Muscular process for image focus on short distances)
	- Secondary (2D, monocular)
		- Light and shade
		- Linear perspective
			- Lines to a vanishing point
			- Height in horizontal plane
				- Black pieces are further up the image![](Pasted%20image%2020230923120319.png)
		- ![](Pasted%20image%2020230923120420.png)
			- Motion parallax -> Close things move faster. Hard to show in a single picture, and not exactly what the image shown is
			- Texture gradiant example also shows colour saturation for same effect
Pattern recognition
- #Gestalt laws of perception
	- Proximity
		- Objects close in space or time are understood to be similar or together
	- Continuity
		- Eyes tries to complete patterns visualy. These are not seen as broken half-circles ![](Pasted%20image%2020230923120815.png)
		- Lines at the edges here are assumed to continue to the same length as the rest![](Pasted%20image%2020230923120945.png)
	- Part-whole relationshps
		- The whole is greater and ***Something other*** than the sum of the parts
		- Same number of letters here, but the left seems "more" as it fits. Often used in logos which make up more than parts![](Pasted%20image%2020230923121102.png)
	- Similarity
		- Similar things seem groped together. This is seen as 3 rows, not 6 columns![](Pasted%20image%2020230923121155.png)
		- Designing pages this can clearly organise content
	- Closure
		- Closed figures are more easily perceived than incomplete figures
		- This can be seen as a connected Maltese cross, not just 3 triangles![](Pasted%20image%2020230923121315.png)
	- Figure / Ground

## Affordances
Opportunities presented in an environment. User must themselves be able to percieve and use opportunities / ressources

> "The affordance of the environment are what it offers animals, what is provides or furnishes, for good or ill" - (Gibson 1977)

>"An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. it is both physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer" - (Gibson, 1986, p. 129)

- Well designed doors don't tell push/pull. A handle and door design tells us to pull, plate maybe tells push

#### Norman affordance
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART

- Given that we are used to scroll bars, they present an opportunity to scroll and see more content
- We know when we can drag a button along a line, or how "sliding" radio buttons work, similar to light switch.
- These are simply things we have learned over time

## Navigation
How we move through an environment

- Informational signs (Object identification)
	- Orienting oneself
	- Providing information on objects
	- Aid in object identification and classification
	- Examples
		- Links / buttons change color when hovering -> can be clicked
		- Sports -> Baseball -> NLB (major league) -> Scoreboard -> Overview of scores from games -> Details of single game![](Pasted%20image%2020230923122406.png)
		- Dotted lie indicates could have gone directly to scoreboard, instead of scroll down past other stories and finding table first![](Pasted%20image%2020230923122612.png)
- Directional signs (Wayfinding)
	- 4-Step process (Downs and Stea (1973), Passini (1994))
		- Orienting oneslef in the environment
		- Choosing the correct route
		- Monitoring this route
		- Recognising that the destination has been reached
	- Directional signs that can help routing
		- Choosing the correct route
		- Providing information on routes and route hierarchies (general / local directions)
		- Apple guidelines - On good path is better than multiple bad ones:
			- Provide one path for one destination (avoids confusion)
			- Make the path logical
- Warning and reassurance signs (Exploration)
	- Eyes naturally follow the shape of an F![](Pasted%20image%2020230923123245.png)
