## What is User Experience (UX)

#### Usability
*A **Quality** in design*

Definition is pretty  narrow

ISO 9241 definition:
> “The **effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction** with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments” 
> 
> **Effectiveness**: the accuracy and completeness with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments’
> 
> **Efficiency**: the resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness of goals achieved
> 
> **Satisfaction**: the comfort and acceptability of the work system to its users and other people affected by its use

#### User Experience
Much broader than usability

ISO 9241-210 definition:
> “A person's **perceptions** and **responses** that result from the **use** or **anticipated use** of a product, system or service…"

From papers:
> ISO definition is accurate, but anticipated use and object of UX will need further explication

> UX Really is wider than other similar areas

> UX has suffered a dimensionality explosion, losing relation to established constructs

- It is wide, but relies on a system that works

Games need to be usable, but joy comes form UX
## Meassuring UX with Questionairs

Done much like usabilty with tests or questionaries

#### Attrakdiff

User rates experience by how close it is to 1 of 2 opposite adjectives

#### Pitfalls of retrospective questionnaires
- Unable to get moment-to-moment snapshots
- User may only remember most positive / negative or most recent experience
	- Resensy bias
- User may mostly answer from average, losing detail



## Emotions and UX

> Emotion affects how we plan to interact with products, how we actually interact with products, and the perceptions and outcomes that surround those interactions

Participants cross off the option fitting with current emotions

Based on the idea that emotional responses are measured in 3 ways
- Affective reports
- Physiological reactivity
- Overt behavioural acts
Often used with real time gathering of biosignals EMG, GSR (Galvanic skin response - meassures arousing) and video
	- GSR is accurate, but doesn't explain why
- Face-reader AI software is also possible

Cue recall debrief
- Alternative to freeze probe - Stopping task to ask, then continueing
- Using GSR data is gathered live

#### From a Practical Perspective
> Consider a **mixed-methods approach**. As you have already seen, there can be multiple measurements and techniques to assess user experience and they can be used in **combination** to have the most benefit. We might **measure time** to complete a game level in seconds and **match that up to GSR** data to see where players get **frustrated**

## Alternative usability evaluation methods

Requires a lot of preparation and analysis time

## Instant Data Analysis (IDA)
Shortened analysis time to just part of test day

Test performed as usual.
- IDA vs video data analysis taking long time

IDA
- Done immediately after last session
	- Brainstorm
	- Tasks
	- Logger's notes
- Almost as strong
	- Finds as many critical problems
	- Slightly less severe / cosmetic issues 

#### Remote testing
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004180633.png)
- RS works like local, but in a remote call
- AU/AE studies user movements (close to data analytics)

RS performs almost the same

Remote studies where usability is defined to the user, and then a task is given can in cases be almost as good as lab studies
