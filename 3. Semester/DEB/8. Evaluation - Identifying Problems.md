## What is a usability problem?
User- vs expert-based
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004161754.png)

#### Sample test "PinTheDay.com"
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004162002.png)
From watching the clip:
1. Identify what usability problems the test user experiences
	1. User couldn't find "collab" button
	2. User thought she had invited someone, but never actually completed it
	3. Scenario text was misunderstood. Tried inviting when she should collaborate.
2. Note the user behaviour and why this indicates usability problems.
	1. Delayed, confusing prevents completing the task
	2. Confused, changes strategy 3x

Second clip:
1. Identify what usability problems the test user experiences
	1. Unclear meaning of "Preview current invitation"
	2. Not sure what the QR code does
	3. Misses the "send invite" buttons 
	4. Instead goes on to different screen, trying to invite manually
2. Note the user behaviour and why this indicates usability problems.
	1. Delayed
	2. Confused
	3. Changing strategy

## Identifying Problematic Issues with Test Moderators
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004163155.png)
Watching clips again, now about the moderator
- Appears better knowing - Commands test subject, laughs at error
	- Very leading questions
- Does not establish good relations - Commanding seems controlling and puts subject on edge
	- Subject is slow to answer, nervous about being wrong because moderator can seem condescending.
- Controlling rather than supporting - Moderator stops mistakes, but should ask her what in the description makes her think she should do it. 

Facebook example:
- Moderator is very hands off, only speaking when asked, letting the user make mistakes
- Supports while constraining himself
- Moderator could have prompted to think aloud about specific things, instead of just noting everything

## The log file
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004164723.png)

Follows form:

| Timestamp | Transcription | Problem                   |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 03:24     | Lorem Ipsum   | P1: Unclear how to invite | 

Add "P-numbers" to problems, to easily track down
- Raw data converted to short statements describing the problem

## Describing Usability Problems

Start with a problem list
#### The problem list
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004165106.png)

Follows form:

| ID  | Problem Description                                                                                       | Category | Experienced by<br>1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| P1  | Unclear how to invite <br><br>The user wanted to... But the order in doing is unclear... similar words... | Serious  | x \| x \|   \| x                   |
| ... | ...                                                                                                       | ...      | ...                                | 

## Categorising problems
Typically three categories
- Critical, Serious, Cosmetic
- In case of different experience of severity, you will typically chose the most severe

Critical problem
- Unable to continue
- Feels the system behaves strongly irritating
- Critical difference between believed and actual state of the system

**Catastrophic**
- More than one user experience the same critical problem independently
	- May want to delay further tests until it is fixed, depending on what it is

#### Rubin and Chisnell
>“Criticality is defined as the combination of the severity of a problem and the probability that the problem will occur. If you represented criticality as an equation, it would look like this:
>
>Criticality = Severity + Probability of Occurrence”

Yes they ***ADD*** them...
