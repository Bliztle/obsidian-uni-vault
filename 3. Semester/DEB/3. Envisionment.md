Conceptual scenarios -> Concrete scenarios
- More specific interface elements

## What is envisionment
- Making ideas visible
- Externalisation
	- Representing design products to ourselves and others
- Generation, communication, and evaluation of ideas based on represented designs
	- Creating concepts
	- Using those to communicate ideas and evaluate interface
	- NO ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY

### Representations
Choose the correct type
- Exploration
	- Sketches / Wireframes
- Accuracy
	- Prototypes
Only do what is relevant, and make sure the main feature to test stands out

Rich pictures is an example

Representations can be directly tied to the list of requirements to show if the concept fulfills them.
### Exploration - Basic techniques
- Sketching
	- Outlining the rough interface of a page
	- May just show where what information is
	- Tools:
		- Balsamiq
			- Purposefully vague to not enforce a styling type
- Storyboards
	- Examples of user flow with small illustrations and text
	- Describes for than simply the 2D interface
- Wireframes
	- Tool to make something that looks like (but is not) a working, interactive system
	- More precise than sketches
- Navigational maps
	- Map displaying flow between different parts of the page

## Accuracy (Prototypes) - Basic techniques
Has interactivity

| Fidelity     | Details                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low (lo-fi)  | Easy to make, broad emphasis on: Content, Structure, Key functions, navigation                             |
| High (Hi-fi) | Highly accurate, interactive, close to pixel perfect. Use for evaluation of specific elements and features | 

- lo-fi
	- Can be paper prototypes with multiple screens (pieces of paper)
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020230909213539.png)
	- User tells what they want to do, and you navigate them
	- Evaluate how well it works, can user navigate seemlessly
	- **Can also be used to let user quickly make their own idea**
	- Tool
		- Marvel App
			- Simple way to make click-through demo, to cycle through and get quickly interactive version
		- Marvel POP App
			- Goes further by adding icons and prebuild things. 
				- Hi-fi - be careful if not needed
- hi-fi
	- Almost fully interactive
	- Used when design is stabilising
	- See if users are able to complete full tasks as expected
	- Example
		- Left is hi-fi prototype, right is final version ![](Pasted%20image%2020230909214238.png)
		- Doesn't have maybe full branding, but shows functionality
	- Tools
		- Adobe XD
			- Multiple platforms, create url to test on phone
		- Figma + Bravo studio
			- Make clickthrough demo on phone without code
			- Pulls data from a google spreadsheet

- Ecological validity - Test is valid in the ecology actual use exists in
- Dangers of hi-fi
	- We may accidently commit too early, and stick with the design we hi-fi'd
	- Customers may believe product is done, and not understand further time spent.
		- Build proper expectations
		- Make clear to user what can be changed
			- Full design may not be final at all, but users won't give large feedback if they think it is.
